[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is great for writing scientific documents with reproducible analyses. The [aqaquarto extension](https://wjschne.github.io/apaquarto/) for Quarto will create documents in [APA style](https://apastyle.apa.org/), rendering to the document format of your choice: .docx, .html, or .pdf.

Although I have worked hard to document all of apaquarto's [options](https://wjschne.github.io/apaquarto/options.html) and [features](https://wjschne.github.io/apaquarto/writing.html), even I was starting to lose track of them all. To make the initial setup of an apaquarto document a little easier, try the [apaquarto web app](https://wjschne.github.io/apa7maker/).

Because the app is made with [shinylive](https://posit-dev.github.io/r-shinylive/), your data stays entirely private because it runs locally on your machine. Be patient, it takes a moment or two to load. 

Using the app is straightforward: Fill in the text boxes, select the check boxes, etc. The table for completing the authors and affiliations is a little finicky, so be sure to finish editing by pressing the Enter/Return key in each cell.

When you are ready, select the *Make Document* page on the side menu. Click *Update*, copy the resulting text, and paste it into your Quarto document.

Let me know your ideas for improving the app and/or apaquarto. [schneider@temple.edu](mailto:schneider@temple.edu)

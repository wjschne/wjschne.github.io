Every year Posit holds a contest for the best statistical table. The [2025 contest results](https://posit.co/blog/2025-table-contest-winners/) have some fantastic tables covering a diverse range of purposes, methods, and aesthetics. The winner was Martin Stavro's [interactive app](https://github.com/mstavro/fleetR) that displays characteristics of the United Airlines Fleet. 

Eight special prize categories were also announced. It was gratifying that my [24-part series](https://wjschne.github.io/posts/apatables/apa701.html), in which I recreate the tables in the *APA Publication Manual*, won the the prize for Best Tutorial. I have been informed that a small prize is in the mail!

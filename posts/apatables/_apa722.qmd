# Making tables in APA style (Part 22 of 24)

In this 24-part series, each of the tables in Chapter 7 of the *Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association* (7th Edition) is recreated with [apa7](https://wjschne.github.io/apa7/), [flextable](https://ardata-fr.github.io/flextable-book/), [easystats](https://easystats.github.io/easystats/), and [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) functions.

:::{.callout-note}
# Highlights

* Use of [`hanging_indent`](https://wjschne.github.io/apa7/reference/hanging_indent.html)

:::

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| include: false
library(apa7)
library(flextable)
library(ftExtra)
library(tidyverse)
library(easystats)
library(lme4)
set_flextable_defaults(theme_fun = theme_apa, 
                       font.family = "Times New Roman")

```

```{r postsetup, eval=FALSE}
<<setup>>
```


![Screenshot of the *APA Manual*'s Table 7.22](table722.png){#fig-722 width="100%"}

Making this table was relatively straightforward, except that I needed to play with the column widths and hanging indents until they fit in a table that is 6.5 inches wide.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-722
#| tbl-cap: "Master Narrative Voices: Struggle and
#|           Success and Emancipation"
#| echo: fenced
tibble(
  theme = c(
    "Struggle and success",
    "Struggle and success",
    "Emancipation",
    "Emancipation"),
  `Discourse and dimension` = c(
    paste("Self actualization as a member of a larger",
          "gay community is the end goal of healthy sexual",
          "identity development or \"coming out\""),
    paste("Maintaining healthy sexual identity entails",
          "vigilance against internalization of",
          "societal discrimination"),
    paste("Open exploration of an individually fluid",
          "sexual self is the goal of healthy sexual",
          "identity development"),
    paste("Questioning discrete, monolithic categories of",
          "sexual identity")),
  `Example quote` = c(
    paste(
      "\"My path of gayness...going from denial to saying,",
      "'well, this is it,' and then the process of coming",
      "out, and the process of just sort of looking around",
      "and seeing, well where do I stand in the world? And",
      "sort of having, uh, political feelings.\"",
      "(Carl, age 50)"),
    paste("\"When I'm, like, thinking of criticisms of",
      "more mainstream gay culture, I try to...make sure",
      "it's coming from an appropriate place and not, like,",
      "a place of self loathing.\" (Patrick,age 20)"),
    paste("\"[For heterosexuals] the man penetrates the",
      "woman, whereas with gay people, I feel like there",
      "is this potential for really playing around with",
      "that model a lot, you know, and just experimenting",
      "and exploring.\" (Orion, age 31)"),
    paste("\"LGBTQI, you know, and added on so many letters.",
      "It does start to raise the question about what the",
      "terms mean and whether...any term can adequately be",
      "descriptive.\" (Bill, age 50 )"))

    `Discourse and dimension` = hanging_indent(
      `Discourse and dimension`,
      width = 29, indent = 4),
        `Example quote` = hanging_indent(

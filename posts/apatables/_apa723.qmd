# Making tables in APA style (Part 23 of 24)

In this 24-part series, each of the tables in Chapter 7 of the *Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association* (7th Edition) is recreated with [apa7](https://wjschne.github.io/apa7/), [flextable](https://ardata-fr.github.io/flextable-book/), [easystats](https://easystats.github.io/easystats/), and [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) functions.

:::{.callout-note}
# Highlights

* Use of [`hanging_indent`](https://wjschne.github.io/apa7/reference/hanging_indent.html)
* Use of [`flextable::merge_v`](https://davidgohel.github.io/flextable/reference/merge_v.html) to remove redundant content

:::

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| include: false
library(apa7)
library(flextable)
library(ftExtra)
library(tidyverse)
library(easystats)
library(lme4)
set_flextable_defaults(theme_fun = theme_apa, 
                       font.family = "Times New Roman")

```

```{r postsetup, eval=FALSE}
<<setup>>
```


![Screenshot of the *APA Manual*'s Table 7.23](table723.png){#fig-723 width="100%"}

Making this table was relatively straightforward, except that I needed to play with the column widths and hanging indents until they fit in a table that is 6.5 inches wide.

The `Reason for interest` column needed vertical merging to remove redundant content.

The frequency column was aligned on the decimal with [`align_chr`](https://wjschne.github.io/apa7/reference/align_chr.html).

```{r}

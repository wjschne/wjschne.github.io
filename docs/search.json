I teach courses in assessment, counseling, statistics, and research methods.\nI grew up in Southern California (1970–1990) and lived in Córdoba, Argentina (1990–1992). I completed my undergraduate degree in Psychology at the University of California at Berkeley in 1995 and my doctoral studies in clinical psychology at Texas A&M University in 2003. My internship year (2001–2002) was spent in the Dutchess County Department of Behavioral & Community Health in Poughkeepsie, NY. Since then I have been a faculty member at Illinois State University (2002–2017) and Temple University (2017–Present)."

It has one additional plot checking the collinearity of the predictors. If any predictor is strongly predictable from the other predictors, it is difficult for ordinary least squares regression to locate the regression coefficients with precision. Why? Because the regression coefficients represent the independent effect of each variable controlling for all the other variables. If a predictor has little variability left after controlling for the other variables, estimating its independent effect is difficult, which is manifest in “inflated” standardized errors around the coefficient. The VIF (variance inflation factor) statistic estimates how much the standard errors are made large due to collinearity. If the VIF is larger than 10 or so, it is likely that the estimate of the coefficient is not precise."

    "text": "Comparing models\nIn the first model, there was only one predictor. The second model had an additional predictor. To test whether the second predictor has incremental validity (predicts variance in the outcome beyond what is predicted by other predictors), we can compare the two models using the Wald test:\n\ntest_wald(m1, m2)\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nModel\ndf\ndf_diff\nF\np\n\n\n\n\nm1\nlm\n38\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nm2\nlm\n37\n1\n23.55975\n2.21e-05\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Wald test can also be conducted in base R with the anova function:\n\nanova(m1, m2)\n\n\n\n\n\nRes.Df\nRSS\nDf\nSum of Sq\nF\nPr(&gt;F)\n\n\n\n\n38\n273.1419\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n37\n166.8806\n1\n106.2612\n23.55975\n2.21e-05\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEither way, the p-value is significant, meaning that m2 explains more variance than m1.\nThe semi-partial correlation coefficient squared tells us how much incremental variance each predictor has over the other:\n\nr2_semipartial(m2)\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm\nr2_semipartial\nCI\nCI_low\nCI_high\n\n\n\n\navgphgt\n0.1077264\n0.95\n0.0192805\n1\n\n\ngender\n0.1398220\n0.95\n0.0371881\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, gender explains 14% variance beyond avgphgt. Likewise, avgphgt explains 11% variance beyond gender.\n\nBayes Factors\nAn alternate method of comparing two models uses the Bayes factor. It tells us under which model the observed data are more probable.\n\ntest_bf(m1, m2)\n\n\n\n\n\nModel\nlog_BF\nBF\n\n\n\n\navgphgt\nNA\nNA\n\n\navgphgt + gender\n8.009811\n3010.348\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA BF &gt; 1 means that m2 is more strongly supported than m1. A BF &lt; 1 means that m1 is more strongly supported than m2. If you are not sure how to interpret the output of test_bf, you can get an automated interpretation:\n\ntest_bf(m1, m2) %&gt;% \n  report()\n\nBayes factors were computed using the BIC approximation, by which BF10 =\nexp((BIC0 - BIC1)/2). Compared to the avgphgt model, we found extreme evidence\n(BF = 3.01e+03) in favour of the avgphgt + gender model (the least supported\nmodel).\n\n\nTo compare many performance statistics at once:\n\ncompare_performance(m1, m2) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nModel\nAIC\nAIC_wt\nAICc\nAICc_wt\nBIC\nBIC_wt\nR2\nR2_adjusted\nRMSE\nSigma\n\n\n\n\nm1\nlm\n196.3596\n0.0001428\n197.0262\n0.0001811\n201.4262\n0.0003321\n0.640591\n0.6311328\n2.613149\n2.681034\n\n\nm2\nlm\n178.6511\n0.9998572\n179.7939\n0.9998189\n185.4066\n0.9996679\n0.780413\n0.7685434\n2.042551\n2.123744"

    "text": "When analyzing questionnaire data, I sometimes put the text of several questions on the y-axis of a plot. Longer text strings will usually make the plot too narrow.\nSuppose we give an admittedly silly questionnaire about preference for darker food. We want to display the percentages of people answering “Yes” to each question.\nHere are the questions and the (completely made-up) percentages:\n# To install the WJSmisc package:\n# remotes::install_github(\"wjschne/WJSmisc\")\nlibrary(WJSmisc)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nd &lt;- tibble(Item = c(\"When you drink coffee, do you prefer darker roasts?\",\n                     \"Is pumpernickel the best bread?\",\n                     \"Do you like dark chocolate more than you like milk chocolate?\",\n                     \"Are black olives better than green olives?\",\n                     \"Do you enjoy the taste of prunes more than can be prudently admitted aloud?\",\n                     \"Is black licorice the secret to a happly life?\"),\n            Percentage = c(45,4,37, 84,2, 3)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Item = fct_reorder(Item, Percentage))\nA preliminary plot might look like this:\nmyfont &lt;- \"Roboto Condensed\"\nmycolors &lt;- viridis::viridis(n = nrow(d), begin = .2, end = .8) |&gt; tinter::lighten(.5)\nmytextsize &lt;- 17\nmytext &lt;- \"gray60\"\np &lt;- ggplot(d, aes(Percentage, Item)) + \n  geom_col(aes(fill = factor(Percentage))) + \n  geom_richlabel(aes(label = paste0(Percentage, \"%\"), \n                     color = factor(Percentage)), \n                 hjust = 0, fill = \"black\",\n                 text_size = mytextsize,\n                 family = myfont) +\n  labs(y = NULL,\n       caption = \"Note: These numbers were made up for illustrative purposes.\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = mytextsize, base_family = myfont) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\"Percent Yes\", \n                     limits = c(0,100), \n                     breaks = NULL,\n                     expand = expansion(mult = c(0,.2))) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = mycolors) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = mycolors) +\n  theme(plot.title.position = \"plot\", \n        plot.background = element_rect(\"black\"),\n        plot.title = element_text(colour = mytext),\n        plot.caption = element_text(color = \"gray40\"),\n        legend.position = \"none\",\n        axis.title = element_text(color = mytext),\n        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.text = element_text(color = mycolors))\np + ggtitle(\"Y-axis labels with no text wrapping\")\nThe questions are taking up a lot of space. We can fix this by using stringr::str_wrap to make the text lines no longer than a specified width:\np + \n  scale_y_discrete(labels = \\(x) str_wrap(x, width = 30)) + \n  ggtitle(\"Splitting Y-axis labels with str_wrap\")\nThis is a definite improvement, but I wish the lines of text were wrapped more evenly. For example, I do not like the fact that “chocolate” and “bread” are by themselves on their own lines. I have spent a fair amount of time breaking lines up by hand and hoped to create a function to automate the process. To achieve a more balanced style of text splitting, I made the str_wrap_equal function.\np + scale_y_discrete(labels = \\(x) str_wrap_equal(x, max_width = 30)) + \n  ggtitle(\"Splitting Y-axis labels with str_wrap_equal\")\nTo each their own, but this style of text wrapping feels better to me here. It is the sort of thing no one but the analyst will notice if it is right but will feel a bit off if not.\nFor your convenience and mine, I put the str_wrap_equal function in the WJSmisc package."

    "text": "I am writing a (still very much unfinished) psychometrics book with suggested exercises using R. I wanted to provide solutions to the questions, but I wanted to hide the answers until the reader clicks them.\nAn easy way to create collapsible content is with html’s &lt;details&gt; tag. For example:\nCreate a variable `x`, and assign it a value of 5.\n\n&lt;details&gt;\n  &lt;summary&gt;Suggested Solution&lt;/summary&gt;\n\n```{r}\nx &lt;- 5\n```\n\n&lt;/details&gt;\nCreate a variable x, and assign it a value of 5.\n\n\nSuggested Solution\n\n\nx &lt;- 5\n\n\n\nHowever, I did not want to worry about all the &lt;details&gt; every time I wrote a question. To automate this process, I used two knitr hooks: a chunk hook and an option hook.\nChunk hooks are for customizing the output of a chunk.\nHere I create a new chunk hook that is run before and after the chunk. When it is run before the chunk, it adds the &lt;details&gt; and &lt;summary&gt; tags. After the chunk, it closes the &lt;details&gt; tag.\n\n# Add the details tag before running the chunk \n# and close the tag after running the chunk.\nknitr::knit_hooks$set(\n  solutionsetter = function(before,options) {\n  \n  if (before) {\n    \n    \"\\n\\n&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Suggested Solution&lt;/summary&gt;\\n\\n\"\n    \n  } else {\n    \n    \"\\n\\n&lt;/details&gt;\\n\\n\"\n    \n  }\n})\n\nIf all we needed to do was to enclose the output into a &lt;details&gt; tag, then just the solutionsetter hook would be needed. However, I also wanted to set echo=TRUE so that the output would be visible even if the default for echo was FALSE.\nOption hooks are great for when you have a kind of chunk you will use often, and it requires setting many chunk options at once (e.g., a plot variant with different dimensions than your default plot has).\nHere I create a new option hook called solution. It sets the current chunk’s echo option to TRUE and also triggers the new solutionsetter code chunk below. The updated options list needs to be returned explicitly, or the hook will not work.\n\nknitr::opts_hooks$set(solution = function(options) {\n  options$echo &lt;- TRUE\n  options$solutionsetter &lt;- TRUE\n  return(options)\n})\n\nNow all need to do is to set my chunk option to solution = TRUE and the output will be collapsible:\n\nCreate a variable `x`, and assign it a value of 5.\n\n```{r, solution = TRUE}\nx &lt;- 5\n```\nCreate a variable x, and assign it a value of 5.\n\n\n\nSuggested Solution\n\nx &lt;- 5\n\n\n\n\nThe details package\nIf you want a function to enclose the output of a chunk or inline code in &lt;details&gt; tags, use the details package by Jonathan Sidi. For example, an inline chunk like this:\n`r details::details(\"Answer\", summary = \"Question\")`\nWill output like so:\n\n\n Question \n\n\nAnswer\n\n\nThe package has many other uses, which are explained in the package’s vignettes.\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{schneider2023,\n  author = {Schneider, W.

    "text": "Setup\nThis trick takes a lot of work. I only use it when I need a plot to look its best.\nSuppose I have a Likert questionnaire item with responses ranging from Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree. Let’s say I have many groups in my study (e.g., college majors), and I want to compare their responses to the item.\nFirst I will create fake data for 26 groups, A–Z.\n\nlibrary(extrafont)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nmyfont &lt;- \"Roboto Condensed\"\n\nd &lt;- tibble(Group = LETTERS[1:26],\n            mu = rnorm(26, 0, .5),\n            sigma = 1) %&gt;%\n  mutate(x = pmap(list(mean = mu, sd = sigma), rnorm, n = 500)) %&gt;%\n  unnest(x) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Agree = cut_number(x, 6) %&gt;%\n           factor(\n             labels = c(\n               \"Strongly\\nDisagree\",\n               \"Disagree\",\n               \"Slightly\\nDisagree\",\n               \"Slightly\\nAgree\",\n               \"Agree\",\n               \"Strongly\\nAgree\"\n             )\n           )) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Group, Agree) %&gt;%\n  summarise(n = n(), .groups = \"drop\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(Group) %&gt;%\n  arrange(Group, Agree) %&gt;%\n  mutate(p = n / sum(n)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n\n\nFirst Attempts at Plotting\n\nd %&gt;%\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(p, Group)) +\n  geom_col(aes(fill = fct_rev(Agree))) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(NULL,\n                       begin = .15,\n                       end = 0.8,\n                       direction = -1) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\"Percent\", expand = expansion()) +\n  scale_y_discrete(\"Group\", expand = expansion()) +\n  coord_fixed(1 / 20.5, clip = \"off\") +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = p, label = round(100 * p, 0)),\n    color = \"white\",\n    family = myfont,\n    position = position_stack(vjust = .5)\n  )\n\n\n\n\nNot bad, but it would look better if we sorted the groups. We have many sorting options. One is that we can convert the Likert scale to numeric and then sort by the group with the highest mean.\n\nd %&gt;%\n  mutate(Group = fct_reorder(Group, .x = as.numeric(Agree) * p, \n                             .fun = mean)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(p, Group)) +\n  geom_col(aes(fill = fct_rev(Agree))) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(NULL,\n                       begin = .15,\n                       end = 0.8,\n                       direction = -1) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\"Percent\", expand = expansion()) +\n  scale_y_discrete(\"Group\", expand = expansion()) +\n  coord_fixed(1 / 20.5, clip = \"off\") +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = p, label = round(100 * p, 0)),\n    color = \"white\",\n    family = myfont,\n    position = position_stack(vjust = .5)\n  )\n\n\n\n\nIf I wanted to sort by the “Strongly Agree” category (or any other category):\n\nd %&gt;%\n  mutate(Group = fct_reorder(\n    Group,\n    .x = (Agree == \"Strongly\\nAgree\") * p,\n    .fun = mean\n  )) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(p, Group)) +\n  geom_col(aes(fill = fct_rev(Agree))) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(NULL,\n                       begin = .15,\n                       end = 0.8,\n                       direction = -1) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\"Percent\", expand = expansion()) +\n  scale_y_discrete(\"Group\", expand = expansion()) +\n  coord_fixed(1 / 20.5, clip = \"off\") +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = p, label = round(100 * p, 0)),\n    color = \"white\",\n    family = myfont,\n    position = position_stack(vjust = .5)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Plot\nSo far, these plots look pretty good. However, I wish that the percentage labels were placed in a more aesthetically pleasing way. I am going to group by each of the response categories and then create a loess regression equation to smooth out the placement. It will mean that the labels are no longer centered in the stacked bars, but I think the sacrifice is worth it. I think that the percentage values are much easier to compare because the eye can follow the smooth line of labels.\n\nd &lt;- tibble(Group = LETTERS[1:26],\n            mu = rnorm(26, 0, .5),\n            sigma = 1) %&gt;%\n  mutate(x = pmap(list(mean = mu, sd = sigma), rnorm, n = 500)) %&gt;%\n  unnest(x) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Agree = cut_number(x, 6) %&gt;%\n           factor(\n             labels = c(\n               \"Strongly\\nDisagree\",\n               \"Disagree\",\n               \"Slightly\\nDisagree\",\n               \"Slightly\\nAgree\",\n               \"Agree\",\n               \"Strongly\\nAgree\"\n             )\n           )) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Group = fct_reorder(Group, as.numeric(Agree), .fun = mean)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Group, Agree) %&gt;%\n  summarise(n = n(), .groups = \"drop\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(Group_position = as.numeric(Group)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Group) %&gt;%\n  arrange(Group, Agree) %&gt;%\n  mutate(p = n / sum(n),\n         # proportion in each response category by group\n         cp = cumsum(p),\n         # cumulative proportion\n         xpos = cp - p / 2 # center of each stacked bar\n         ) %&gt;%\n         group_by(Agree) %&gt;%\n           nest() %&gt;%\n           mutate(\n             fit = map(data,\n                       loess,\n                       formula = \"xpos ~ Group_position\",\n                       span = 0.45),\n             # loess regression for each response category\n             xhat = map(fit, predict) # x-axis position on smooth line\n           ) %&gt;%\n           select(-fit) %&gt;%\n           unnest(c(data, xhat)) %&gt;%\n           mutate(Group = factor(Group, labels = rev(LETTERS[1:26])))\n         \n         d %&gt;%\n           ggplot(mapping = aes(p, Group)) +\n           geom_col(aes(fill = fct_rev(Agree))) +\n           geom_text(aes(x = xhat,\n                         label = ifelse(p &gt; .01, # No labels on small bars\n                                        round(100 * p, 0),\n                                        \"\")),\n                     color = \"white\",\n                     family = myfont) +\n           scale_fill_viridis_d(begin = .15,\n                                end = 0.8,\n                                direction = -1) +\n           scale_x_continuous(\"Percent\", expand = expansion()) +\n           scale_y_discrete(\"Group\", expand = expansion()) +\n           coord_fixed(1 / 20.5, clip = \"off\") +\n           theme_minimal(base_size = 13, base_family = myfont) +\n           theme(\n             legend.position = \"top\",\n             legend.box.spacing = unit(0.5, \"mm\"),\n             legend.text = element_text(\n               color = \"white\",\n               size = 13,\n               margin = margin(b = -40),\n               # Lower legend text into box\n               vjust = 0.5\n             ),\n             legend.spacing.x = unit(0, \"mm\"),\n             axis.text.y = element_text(hjust = 0.5)\n           ) +\n           guides(\n             fill = guide_legend(\n               title = NULL,\n               nrow = 1,\n               # Put legend on a single row\n               reverse = T,\n               # Reverse order of legend\n               label.position = \"top\",\n               # Put text atop keys\n               keyheight = unit(15, \"mm\"),\n               # Size of legend rectangles\n               keywidth = unit(22.56, \"mm\")\n             )\n           ) \n\n\n\n\nThis feels right to me.\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{schneider2021,\n  author = {Schneider, W.

    "text": "I would like to label points on a sine function so that the labels are always legible. In a sine wave plot in which θ ranges from 0 to 2π, sin(θ) ranges from −1 to +1. Thus, the plot’s xy ratio is\n\\text{plot ratio}= \\frac{2\\pi-0}{1- (-1)}=\\pi\nThe first derivative of the sine function is the cosine function. In my plot, the slope of the tangent line at each point is\n\n\\text{tangent slope} = \\text{plot ratio}\\times \\cos(\\theta)\n The angle of the tangent line’s slope is the arctan of the slope. I would like to place the label perpendicular to the tangent line so I will add 90 degrees (i.e., π/2 radians).\n\n\\text{text angle}=\\tan^{-1}(\\text{tangent slope})+\\pi/2\n\nNow I need a pair of functions that will convert this angle into the right values for ggplot2’s hjust and vjust arguments.

Examples are provided as to how it is applied to IQ and the death penalty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaking latent variable models seriously\nApplying latent score estimates to individuals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecific cognitive processing weaknesses are rarely full explanations for academic deficits\nIn which I confess to having had a longstanding misunderstanding about diagnosing learning disorders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo kinds of cognitive ability hierarchies\nSome latent variables represent “hierarchical abstractions.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Taxonomy of Influences on Ability Tests\nSome influences are test-specific whereas others are shared across tests. Some influences are transient whereas others are stable. Some influences are relevant to the construct of interest whereas others are irrelevant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin-composite differences: Why measures of the same ability differ?\nThere are a number of lesser-known reasons that two tests that are intended to measure the same ability might differ substantially.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin-composite differences: Do large subtest score differences invalidate composite scores?\nIt is often asserted that composite scores should not be interpreted when the scores that make up that composite are discrepant. I show here why this is not typically true, depending on what the composite score is used for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting Assessment Reports People Will Read, Understand, and Remember\nMy appearance on the School Psyched Podcast on October 20, 2019"

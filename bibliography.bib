  abstract = {The reminiscence bump describes an increased recollection of autobiographic experiences made in adolescence and early adulthood. It is unclear if this phenomenon can also be found for declarative knowledge of past public events. To answer this question, we assessed public events knowledge (PEK) about the past six decades with a 120-item knowledge test across six domains in a sample of 1,012 Germans that were sampled uniformly across the ages 30 to 80 years. General and domain-specific PEK scores were analyzed as a function of age-at-event. Scores were lower for public events preceding participants’ birth and stayed stable from the age-at-event of five to ten years onwards. There was no significant peak in PEK in adolescence or early adulthood, arguing against an extension of the reminiscence effect to factual knowledge. We examined associations between PEK and relevant variables such as crystallized intelligence (Gc), news consumption, and openness to experience with structural equation models. Strong associations between PEK and Gc were established, whereas the associations of PEK with news consumption and openness were mainly driven by their link to declarative knowledge.}

  abstract = {The intelligence-as-process, personality, interests, and intelligence-as-knowledge (PPIK) framework expands on the notions introduced by Cattell in his investment hypothesis. This framework enables to understand adult intellect in general, and to consider how the interactions among process-type intellectual abilities; non-ability traits, such as affective traits and conative traits; and an individual's investment of time and effort lead to the development and maintenance of domain knowledge in adulthood. The development of intelligence-as-knowledge in late adolescence and adulthood appears to be related to an individual's standing on a relatively small number of constellations of non-ability traits, called trait complexes. The introduction of an omnibus test of intelligence specifically designed for adults removes the problems caused by the concept of mental age and by reliance on tests that had been extended from assessment of children. In particular, for both young adults and middle-aged adults, scores on the science/math and intellectual/cultural trait complexes were positively associated with domain knowledge in academic domains, and the social trait complex was negatively correlated with knowledge across nearly all domains. The PPIK theory provides just one perspective on adult intelligence and adult intellectual development among many competing theories. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Data from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care (N = 1273) were analyzed to assess the longitudinal relations among executive function (EF) components in early childhood (54 months) and adolescence (15 years) and their prediction of academic achievement. We found that after controlling for early achievement, demographic, and home environment variables, only working memory at 54 months significantly predicted working memory at 15 years and that working memory was the only significant EF predictor of achievement at age 15. In contrast, all early achievement measures were significant predictors of later achievement. Furthermore, no demographic or home environment variables at 54 months significantly predicted EF at 15, and only maternal education significantly explained variance in adolescent math and literacy achievement. These findings demonstrate the predictability of working memory and highlight its importance for academic outcomes across development. However, the lack of associations of preschool inhibition and attention measures, after controlling for early achievement, demographic, and home environment variables, to corresponding measures in adolescence suggests the need for more developmentally sensitive measures of EF. Given that the EF measures used in this study are commonly used in educational and psychological research, more care should go into understanding the psychometric properties across development.

However, measuring fluid reasoning is not that easy since the operationalization of the construct itself is not conclusive. This situation is exacerbated if the measurements and comparisons are carried out in groups with different cultural and language abilities. The purpose of this paper is to provide a brief overview of the fluid reasoning construct as well as measurement practices that have been carried out in Indonesia. My review would mention the positioning of fluid reasoning in several intelligence theories, how researchers conceptualize fluid reasoning, how researchers measure fluid reasoning in a multicultural context, and outline critical future directions for test development. In conclusion, I emphasize the importance of using a multi-processes figural fluid reasoning test as a proxy for a culture fair intelligence test that can be used in cross-cultural assessments.}

We test the effectiveness of the pedagogy using achievement scores and a novel measure of curiosity. The latter involves creating a sense of information deprivation and quantifying the urge to acquire information and retention ability. The intervention increases curiosity, knowledge retention, and science test scores, with the effects persisting into middle school years. It also leads to more information sharing and peer learning in the classroom. The evidence can help design better pedagogical tools to increase pupil engagement and the quality of learning.

  abstract = {Background               Diverse behaviour problems in childhood correlate phenotypically, suggesting a general dimension of psychopathology that has been called the p factor. The shared genetic architecture between childhood psychopathology traits also supports a genetic p. This study systematically investigates the manifestation of this common dimension across self‐, parent‐ and teacher‐rated measures in childhood and adolescence.                                         Methods                                The sample included 7,026 twin pairs from the Twins Early Development Study (                 TEDS                 ). First, we employed multivariate twin models to estimate common genetic and environmental influences on p based on diverse measures of behaviour problems rated by children, parents and teachers at ages 7, 9, 12 and 16 (depressive traits, emotional problems, peer problems, autism traits, hyperactivity, antisocial behaviour, conduct problems and psychopathic tendencies). Second, to assess the stability of genetic and environmental influences on p across time, we conducted longitudinal twin modelling of the first phenotypic principal components of childhood psychopathological measures across each of the four ages. Third, we created a genetic p factor in 7,026 unrelated genotyped individuals based on eight polygenic scores for psychiatric disorders to estimate how a general polygenic predisposition to mostly adult psychiatric disorders relates to childhood p.                                                        Results               Behaviour problems were consistently correlated phenotypically and genetically across ages and raters. The p factor is substantially heritable (50\%–60\%) and manifests consistently across diverse ages and raters. However, residual variation in the common factor models indicates unique contributions as well. Genetic correlations of p components across childhood and adolescence suggest stability over time (49\%–78\%). A polygenic general psychopathology factor derived from studies of psychiatric disorders consistently predicted a general phenotypic p factor across development (0.3\%–0.9\%).                                         Conclusions               Diverse forms of psychopathology generally load on a common p factor, which is highly heritable. There are substantial genetic influences on the stability of p across childhood. Our analyses indicate genetic overlap between general risk for psychiatric disorders in adulthood and p in childhood, even as young as age 7. The p factor has far‐reaching implications for genomic research and, eventually, for diagnosis and treatment of behaviour problems.},

We examined if people’s scores on the ability-based Test of Personal Intelligence (TOPI) would be reflected in their narratives about someone whose personality they had learned about. In a Preliminary Study (N = 220), we collected narratives and open-ended descriptions about their learning. In Study 1 (N = 212), experts rated the respondents’ open-ended narratives for their sophistication about personality, defined as their knowledge and complexity of thought around the topic. Respondents also filled out checklists concerning what they learned and their relationship outcomes. Study 2 (N = 299) was a replication and extension in which we added the TOPI. Participants who scored higher on the TOPI produced narratives higher in Sophistication, even after statistical controls for Word Count and Vocabulary (the measures also were largely independent of the Big Five). The findings here may have applications for both testing and training.},

  abstract = {Deficits in phonological processing are theorized to be responsible for at least some reading disabilities. A considerable amount of research demonstrates that many students can be taught one of these phonological processes—phonemic awareness. However, not all students have responded favorably to this instruction. Research has suggested that these nonresponders may be unable to retrieve phonological codes quickly from long-term memory. The purpose of this study was to examine whether such a deficiency, which we refer to as lexical retrieval weakness, blunts the effectiveness of combined phonemic awareness and decoding training. To this end, we compared the effectiveness of phonemic awareness and decoding training for students with and without severe lexical retrieval weaknesses. All students in both groups demonstrated poor phonemic awareness. The results suggested that students with relatively strong lexical retrieval skill responded more favorably to beginning reading instruction than did students with weak lexical retrieval skill. In other words, lexical retrieval weakness may influence reading development independently of the effects of phonemic awareness. Implications for instruction are discussed.},

This study assessed the role of cognitive abilities on the performance of three aviation-related jobs: flying, navigation, and air battle management (ABM). Correlated-factor and bifactor models were used to draw a conclusion about the predictive relations between cognitive abilities and job performance. Overall, the importance of particular cognitive abilities tends to vary across the three occupations, and each occupation has different sets of essential abilities. Importantly, the interplay of general versus specific abilities is different across occupations, and some specific abilities also show substantial predictive power.},

The literature review included a computer search of several databases, an ancestral search of relevant articles and books, and a manual search of 11 journals. Twenty-three studies were identified, 8 of which were designed primarily to identify characteristics of unresponsive students; the remaining 15 studies focused on treatment effectiveness but also identified and described unresponsive students. A majority of unresponsive students had phonological awareness deficits. Additional characteristics included phonological retrieval or encoding deficits, low verbal ability, behavior problems, and developmental delays.

Participants were 104 children, including 7 with special needs and Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), who were tested in kindergarten and first grade. Responsiveness/nonresponsiveness status was determined after 2 years during which children participated in best practice instruction (a) in kindergarten and first grade, (b) in kindergarten only, (c) in first grade only, or (d) in neither year. This facilitated the study of three groups. Always responsive students met responsiveness criteria in both years. Sometimes responsive students met the criteria in only one year. Nonresponsive students did not meet the criteria in either year. Multivariate analysis of variance and discriminant function analysis indicated that the three groups were reliably different from one another on measures of problem behavior, verbal memory, sentence imitation, syntactic awareness, vocabulary, naming speed, and segmentation. A combination of naming speed, vocabulary, sentence imitation, problem behavior, and amount of intervention correctly predicted 82.1\% of nonresponsive students, 30.0\% of sometimes responsive students, and 84.1\% of always responsive students. Fifty students from kindergarten and first grade were tested again at the end of what should have been their third-grade year. All but 1 of the nonresponsive students who received intervention had been identified as requiring special education and had an IEP with reading goals.},

Design               Two-sample univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) to estimate the causal effects of education on intelligence and vice versa, and the total and independent causal effects of both education and intelligence on AD risk.                                         Participants               17~008 AD cases and 37~154 controls from the International Genomics of Alzheimer’s Project (IGAP) consortium.                                         Main outcome measure               Odds ratio (OR) of AD per standardized deviation increase in years of schooling (SD\,=\,3.6\,years) and intelligence (SD = 15 points on intelligence test).                                         Results               There was strong evidence of a causal, bidirectional relationship between intelligence and educational attainment, with the magnitude of effect being similar in both directions [OR for intelligence on education = 0.51 SD units, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.49, 0.54; OR for education on intelligence = 0.57 SD units, 95\% CI: 0.48, 0.66]. Similar overall effects were observed for both educational attainment and intelligence on AD risk in the univariable MR analysis; with each SD increase in years of schooling and intelligence, odds of AD were, on average, 37\% (95\% CI: 23–49\%) and 35\% (95\% CI: 25–43\%) lower, respectively. There was little evidence from the multivariable MR analysis that educational attainment affected AD risk once intelligence was taken into account (OR\,=\,1.15, 95\% CI: 0.68–1.93), but intelligence affected AD risk independently of educational attainment to a similar magnitude observed in the univariate analysis (OR\,=\,0.69, 95\% CI: 0.44–0.88).                                         Conclusions               There is robust evidence for an independent, causal effect of intelligence in lowering AD risk. The causal effect of educational attainment on AD risk is likely to be mediated by intelligence.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Many neuropsychologists are of the opinion that the multitude of cognitive tests may be grouped into a much smaller number of cognitive domains. However, there is little consensus on how many domains exist, what these domains are, nor on which cognitive tests belong to which domain. This incertitude can be solved by factor analysis, provided that the analysis includes a broad range of cognitive tests that have been administered to a very large number of people. In this article, two such factor analyses were performed, each combining multiple studies. However, because it was not possible to obtain complete multivariate data on more than the most common test variables in the field, not all possible domains were examined here. The first analysis was a factor meta-analysis of correlation matrices combining data of 60,398 healthy participants from 52 studies. Several models from the literature were fitted, of which a version based on the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) model was found to describe the correlations better than the others. The second analysis was a factor analysis of the Advanced Neuropsychological Diagnostics Infrastructure (ANDI) database, combining scores of 11,881 participants from 54 Dutch and Belgian studies not included in the first meta-analysis. Again, the model fit was better for the CHC model than for other models. Therefore, we conclude that the CHC model best characterizes both cognitive domains and which test belongs to each domain. Therefore, although originally developed in the intelligence literature, the CHC model deserves more attention in neuropsychology.},

  abstract = {In the present study, we explored the unique contribution of reading accuracy, reading fluency and linguistic comprehension within the frame of Simple View of Reading (SVR). The experimental sample included 118 3rd to 5th grade children learning Italian, a language with a highly regular orthography. We adopted a flexible method of analysis, i.e., the Network Analysis (NA), particularly suited for exploring relations among different domains and where the direct relations between a set of intercorrelated variables is the main interest. Results indicated an independent and unique contribution of syntactic comprehension skills as well as reading fluency and reading accuracy in the comprehension of a written text. The decoding measures were not directly associated with non-verbal reasoning and the latter was not directly associated with reading comprehension but was strongly related to oral syntactic comprehension. Overall, the pattern of findings is broadly consistent with the predictions of SVR and underscores how, in an orthographically regular language, reading fluency and reading accuracy as well as oral comprehension skills directly influence reading comprehension. Data are discussed in a cross-linguistic perspective. Implications for education and rehabilitation are also presented.}

A focus on CRT in education emphasizes the continual persistence of racism ingrained in K–12 education located within the educational opportunities, curriculum, representation, and teacher perception of African American males. We offer insight into how school counselors may work to decrease barriers to achievement by analyzing the effect race and gender have on the identification, retention, and underachievement of their African American male students.},

  abstract = {Mental disorders are among the leading causes of global disease burden. To respond effectively, a strong understanding of the structure of psychopathology is critical. We empirically compared two competing frameworks, dynamic-mutualism theory and common-cause theory, that vie to explain the development of psychopathology. We formalized these theories in statistical models and applied them to explain change in the general factor of psychopathology (p factor) from early to late adolescence ( N = 1,482) and major depression in middle adulthood and old age ( N = 6,443). Change in the p factor was better explained by mutualism according to model-fit indices. However, a core prediction of mutualism was not supported (i.e., predominantly positive causal interactions among distinct domains). The evidence for change in depression was more ambiguous. Our results support a multicausal approach to understanding psychopathology and showcase the value of translating theories into testable statistical models for understanding developmental processes in clinical sciences.},

  abstract = {The nature of the relationship between ability and performance is of critical importance for admission decisions in the context of higher education and for personnel selection. Although previous research has supported the more-is-better hypothesis by documenting linearity of ability-performance relationships, such research has not been sensitive enough to detect deviations at the top ends of the score distributions. An alternative position receiving considerable attention is the good-enough hypothesis, which suggests that although higher levels of ability may result in better performance up to a threshold, above this threshold greater ability does not translate to better performance. In this study, the nature of the relationship between cognitive ability and performance was examined throughout the score range in four large-scale data sets. Monotonicity was maintained in all instances. Contrary to the good-enough hypothesis, the ability-performance relationship was commonly stronger at the top end of the score distribution than at the bottom end.},

  abstract = {The Collaborative/Therapeutic Assessment (C/TA) paradigm represents a significant shift from the traditional aims and techniques of psychological assessment. C/TA deliberately employs a variety of evidence-based techniques intended to maximize the potential that the process of assessment will result in meaningful therapeutic benefits for clients. The empirical support for the effectiveness of the C/TA approach is promising and demonstrates direct intervention effects on such indicators as self-esteem and symptomatology, as well as improvements in constructs and processes salient to continued psychological care, including the therapeutic alliance, treatment readiness, and distress. C/TA has also been shown to increase participation and retention in subsequent indicated mental health services for populations that traditionally are difficult to engage. This chapter describes the history and evidence-based theory behind C/TA approaches; describes the steps and procedures of the semi-stuctured Therapeutic Assessment model, and presents a thorough discussion of the application of a variety of therapeutic techniques (e.g., circular questioning, scaffolding, psychoeducation, shame modulation, mentalizing) in the context of the C/TA paradigm that increase the likelihood that assessment will result in clinically relevant outcomes. These techniques are applied in a variety of therapy models in psychology but have only recently been explicitly used in the context of psychological assessment for adults, couples, and families with children or adolescents.},

Helping professionals have searched for ways for adolescents to acquire the skills necessary to face these many changes. Parents, educators and adolescents have tried to do what they can ,not only to survive ,but to make the most of major life transition that occurs from age 10-18 (Arnett, 2000). This study was done to investigate the effect of social skills training on self esteem among male and female adolescent students. The sample consisted of 200 (100 male and 100 female) adolescent students, were selected randomly and divided into experimental and control groups. The experimental group received social skills training in 10 sessions, but the control group didn't attend the sessions. Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale by Rosenberg (1965) was administered in pre and post intervention to measuring Self esteem. Results revealed that social skills training has significantly enhanced self esteem in the selected sample of experimental group and gender did not have differential influence on enhancing self esteem due to social skills training.}

  abstract = {The need to develop alternative models of psycho-educational assessment, more attuned to the logical and empirical requirements of intervention design, has been a central theme of school psychology and special education reform. In response to these challenges, alternative assessment and service delivery models have been proposed in which classification and assessment strategies are linked more directly to principles of intervention design. Yet, the degree to which alternative assessment models may share a number of problems with traditional diagnostic assessment practices has not been analyzed sufficiently. In this paper, the concepts of decision reliability and validity, extensions of reliability and validity theory that encompass decision outcomes, are used to frame a general analysis of three alternative assessment strategies: multiple gating, template matching, and time-series methods. We argue that relatively little knowledge may be gained through the analysis of individual scales and assessment technologies without placing them within a decision-making context and studying individual outcomes.},

Given their use in determining whether students have access to special education and related services, it is important that any method used to identify SLD have supporting evidence. A review of the DD/C evidence indicates it cannot currently be classified as an evidence-based method for identifying individuals with a SLD. We show that the DD/C method is unsound for three major reasons: (a) it requires test scores have properties that they fundamentally lack, (b) lack of experimental utility evidence supporting its use, and (c) evidence supporting the inability of the method to identify SLD accurately.},

  abstract = {Mental retardation (MR) has traditionally been defined as a disorder in intellectual and adaptive functioning beginning in the developmental period. Guided by a federal definition of MR described in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, it is the responsibility of each of the United States to describe eligibility guidelines for special education services. The purpose of this study was to examine eligibility guidelines for MR for the 50 states and the District of Columbia. This study examined the terms used to describe MR, the use of classification levels, the cutoff scores, and the adaptive behavior considerations for each state. In addition, this study examined guidelines for consideration of intelligence test part scores and consideration of the unreliability of IQs through consideration of the standard error of measurement (SEM) or an IQ range. As found in previous studies, results revealed great variation in the specific eligibility guidelines for MR from state to state. The greatest variation appeared to be across the adaptive behavior considerations. Approximately 20\% of states (10) recommend consideration of intelligence test part scores, and approximately 39\% of states (20) recommend attention to unreliability of IQs through consideration of the SEM or an IQ range.}

  abstract = {Previous research has shown that psychometrically assessed cognitive abilities are predictive of achievements in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) even in highly selected samples. Spatial ability, in particular, has been found to be crucial for success in STEM, though its role relative to other abilities has been shown mostly when assessed years before entering higher STEM education. Furthermore, the role of spatial ability for mathematics in higher STEM education has been markedly understudied, although math is central across STEM domains. We investigated whether ability differences among students who entered higher STEM education were predictive of achievements during the first undergraduate year. We assessed 317 undergraduate students in Switzerland (150 from mechanical engineering and 167 from math-physics) on multiple measures of spatial, verbal and numerical abilities. In a structural equation model, we estimated the effects of latent ability factors on students’ achievements on a range of first year courses. Although ability-test scores were mostly at the upper scale range, differential effects on achievements were found: spatial ability accounted for achievements in an engineering design course beyond numerical, verbal and general reasoning abilities, but not for math and physics achievements. Math and physics achievements were best predicted by numerical, verbal and general reasoning abilities. Broadly, the results provide evidence for the predictive power of individual differences in cognitive abilities even within highly competent groups. More specifically, the results suggest that spatial ability’s role in advanced STEM learning, at least in math-intensive subjects, is less critical than numerical and verbal reasoning abilities.},

The analysis of a sample of 909 participants revealed that the RPT and LPT measured a unidimensional construct of FLC, while the PT was excluded due to insufficient fit. Combining RPT and LPT items, various models were evaluated, with a bifactor S-1 model showing the best fit, indicating the influence of a general factor (representing FLC) and test-specific method factors. The study explored FLC allocation within the CHC model, supporting its consideration as a distinct factor under the g factor. Examining the nomological network, significant correlations emerged between the Intellectual Curiosity and Aesthetic Sensitivity facets of Openness and FLC, which were comparable in size to the relation with general ability. In conclusion, the study enhances the understanding of FLC within the CHC model, advocating its recognition as a distinct factor. Correlations with Openness facets suggest valuable insights into the interplay between cognitive abilities and personality, necessitating further research for a deeper exploration of this relation.},

  abstract = {Despite substantial evidence for the link between an individual’s intelligence and successful life outcomes, questions about what defines intelligence have remained the focus of heated dispute. The most common approach to understanding intelligence has been to investigate what performance on tests of intellect is and is not associated with. This psychometric approach, based on correlations and factor analysis is deficient. In this review, we aim to substantiate why classic psychometrics which focus on between-person accounts will necessarily provide a limited account of intelligence until theoretical considerations of within-person accounts are incorporated. First, we consider the impact of entrenched psychometric presumptions that support the status quo and impede alternative views. Second, we review the importance of process-theories, which are critical for any serious attempt to build a within-person account of intelligence. Third, features of dynamic tasks are reviewed, and we outline how static tasks can be modified to target within-person processes. Finally, we explain how multilevel models are conceptually and psychometrically well-suited to building and testing within-individual notions of intelligence, which at its core, we argue is cognitive flexibility. We conclude by describing an application of these ideas in the context of microworlds as a case study.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Transdiagnostic models of psychopathology address many of the shortcomings common to categorical diagnostic systems. These empirically derived models conceptualize psychopathology as a few broad interrelated and hierarchically arranged dimensions, with an overarching general psychopathology dimension, the               p               ‐factor, at the apex. While transdiagnostic models are gaining prominence in mental health research, the lack of available tools has limited their clinical translation. The present study explored the potential of creating transdiagnostic scales from the joint factor structure of the Personality Assessment Inventory, Alternative Model of Personality Disorder trait scales (AMPD), and the clinical scales of the SPECTRA: Indices of Psychopathology (SPECTRA). Exploratory factor analysis in a clinical sample (               n               \,=\,212) identified five factors corresponding to the Negative Affect/Internalizing, Detachment, Antagonism/Externalizing, Disinhibition/Externalizing, and Thought Disorder transdiagnostic dimensions. Goldberg's “Bass‐Ackward” method supported a hierarchical structure. Five composite transdiagnostic scales were created by summing each factor's highest loading PAI and SPECTRA scales. A global psychopathology scale was created by summing the five composite scales. All the composite scales demonstrated adequate internal consistency. Correlations between the composite scales and the NEO Five‐Factor Inventory‐3 provide initial validity evidence for four composite and global scales. The composite thought disorder scale had no conceptually corresponding NEO domain. Clinical implications and study limitations are discussed.},

This study explored the               SPECTRA               's construct validity using a wide range of life event (extra‐test) variables in a clinical sample. The life event variables included the following: education level, school failure, childhood adversity, suicide attempts, psychiatric hospitalizations, depression, psychotic symptoms, self‐injury, substance abuse, arrests, physical violence, marital status, employment status and current medications. Results showed that all               SPECTRA               clinical scales had significant life event correlations. For the higher‐order Spectra scales, the global index of psychopathology had the greatest number and range of life event correlations. Correlations for the externalizing and reality impairing Spectra scales provided solid validity evidence, while correlations for the internalizing Spectra scale were more diffuse. These findings provide the first non‐test‐based evidence of construct validity for the               SPECTRA               .},

  abstract = {There are well-documented associations between numeracy development in preschool age children and general and math vocabulary, literacy, and executive functions. However, the studies have largely included small samples of children with parents with either predominantly low or higher socioeconomic background (SES); further, few studies have included measures of all these domains in the same analyses. In this current study, we examined how general vocabulary, math vocabulary, rhyme detection and three measures of executive functions are associated with numeracy development in a population representative sample of 2,931 Danish children 3–5 years (51\% male, 89\% white). Multi-level regressions controlling for child age and, sex, and in some analyses also parental education and income confirmed that general vocabulary (               β               = 0.16), math language (               β               = 0.17), rhyme detection (               β               = 0.14), attention shifting (               β               = 0.09), inhibitory control (               β               = 0.05), and working memory (               β               = 0.09) each are associated with numeracy after controlling for covariates when estimated in the same model. Analyses of extreme performance (low-high) suggests a much closer and symmetrical connection between math language and numeracy compared to that between general vocabulary and numeracy. Interestingly, family SES is weakly but significantly related to all measures, most strongly for the vocabulary measures, but does not influence the pattern of results from regression analyses. In conclusion, both general vocabulary and mathematics-specific vocabulary contribute substantially to early numeracy skills. Rhyme detection and executive functions are also associated with numeracy skills, but with a lower magnitude.}

The weights that are used in practice can be different (differential weights) or equal (unit weights). Relevant literature across multiple disciplines and multiple decades is reviewed. The literature indicates that unit weights have substantial predictive validity when compared with regression weights, but there is a lack of data on how other differential weighting strategies (e.g., weights generated by subject matter experts) compare to unit weights. In response, a primary and a meta-analytic study are provided here. The recent literature also contains some potential criticisms of unit weights in regard to personnel selection and content validation—and those statements are evaluated. The data and findings indicate that unit weights can be a highly appropriate approach for weighting under many circumstances.},

Accordingly, simulated 					visual imagery gives rise to observer-viewpoint, whereas simulated motor imagery gives rise to character-viewpoint gestures. 					Because little is known about whether this relationship is either the product of becoming a competent speaker in different 					communicative tasks or exists from an early age, we investigated 4-year-olds. In the first session, 55 children performed three 					different communicative tasks. In the second session, we administered a SON-R non-verbal intelligence test to assess children’s 					cognitive abilities. Results revealed a strong association between the frequency with which children used observer-viewpoints 					gestures and their scores in visual processing abilities. Because the association between gestures and visuospatial cognitive 					abilities was found across three communicative tasks, we can propose that it is a general ability rather than a phenomenon of 					task-specific discourse competence. We discuss these findings in terms of gestural threshold and cognitive offloading.},

(2013) proposed a personality-based model of employability that describes individual differences in (1) being rewarding to deal with, (2) being able to learn the job, and (3) being willing to work hard. In this study, we evaluated the model by selecting subscales from the Hogan Personality Inventory (HPI; Hogan \& Hogan, 2007 ) that best predicted supervisor ratings of competencies related to these three constructs. The psychometric properties of those scales were examined in independent samples. Results indicated that the scales converged with similar scales from other instruments, covaried in meaningful ways with observer descriptions, and predicted supervisor ratings of job performance. The measure – which is 64\% shorter than the full HPI – includes personality characteristics applicable to most jobs across multiple job families that can be used to identify successful candidates.},

Cattell's (e.g., 1973, 1982) psychometric research has produced a hierarchical structural model of intellectual abilities, comprising a number of general intellectual factors, together with several primaries and, beyond that, the possibility of numerous specific abilities. It is concluded that his model has received considerable support from empirical research and has been shown to be compatible with information-processing models (e.g., P. Kline, 1979). The hierarchical factoring procedure enables the application of Cattell's depth psychometry approach, wherein the relationship of the primary ability factors to the higher-order factors can be elucidated. Simply retaining the 1st couple of general factors from a factor analysis of abilities would result only in pseudo-higher-order factors, with no information provided about the interaction of the primary abilities in producing the secondary and tertiary ability factors.

Two ways cognitive batteries could inform intervention are identified: a disordinal (i.e., aptitude-treatment interaction) model and an ordinal (i.e., g) model. Existing research provides little support for disordinal models and modest to strong support for ordinal models when applied to conditions of incomplete instruction. Limitations to what can be known (e.g., a failure to prove is not proof of failure) are identified to avoid holding intervention validity research to inappropriate evidential standards. Finally, issues that are within the realm of knowledge but for which there is currently insufficient or no evidence are identified as logical next steps toward understanding the intervention validity of cognitive assessment batteries.},

  abstract = {This chapter presents the phenomenon known as "Spearman's law of diminishing returns" (SLODR). SLODR belongs to the broader research field studying ability differentiation where variances of general and/or specific abilities vary with age or the level of general cognitive ability. Specifically, SLODR implies that the strength with which general intelligence (as represented by the general factor g) affects manifest test scores decreases for individuals with increasing levels of g, while the factor structure of intelligence is the same for all individuals across the whole ability range. Thus, in individuals with low cognitive ability, the g-factor is the main source of (reliable, observed) mental test variance. In individuals with high cognitive ability, however, its impact is reduced, increasing the relative importance of other, more specific cognitive abilities to explain mental test variance. The chapter discusses theoretical implications of this phenomenon for theories of general intelligence. It demonstrates practical implications regarding the ability dependent use and interpretation of intelligence tests by the results of two recent studies.

The causal effect of education on IQ at later ages is often difficult to uncover because analyses based on observational data are plagued by problems of reverse causation and self-selection into further education. We exploit a reform that increased compulsory schooling from 7 to 9 y in Norway in the 1960s to estimate the effect of education on IQ. We find that this schooling reform, which primarily affected education in the middle teenage years, had a substantial effect on IQ scores measured at the age of 19 y.},

The sample consisted of 489 undergraduate students, with dimensional personality traits operationalized via the Comprehensive Assessment of Traits relevant to Personality Disorder (CAT-PD). A priori hypotheses were generated for which MMPI-3 scales would be most associated with each personality trait domain, as well as individual CAT-PD scales. Zero-order correlations and regression analyses were used to examine associations between a set of hypothesized MMPI-3 scale scores and CAT-PD scale scores. The results showed a pattern of meaningful correlations supporting the majority of hypotheses. Moreover, most hypothesized scales also incremented one another in regression models predicting hypothesized PD scale scores. These findings indicate that the MMPI-3 is well situated to aid clinicians in the assessment of personality trait dysfunction from a dimensional perspective.},

  abstract = {Despite a long-standing expert consensus about the importance of cognitive ability for life outcomes, contrary views continue to proliferate in scholarly and popular literature. This divergence of beliefs presents an obstacle for evidence-based policymaking and decision-making in a variety of settings. One commonly held idea is that greater cognitive ability does not matter or is actually harmful beyond a certain point (sometimes stated as {$>$} 100 or 120 IQ points). We empirically tested these notions using data from four longitudinal, representative cohort studies comprising 48,558 participants in the United States and United Kingdom from 1957 to the present. We found that ability measured in youth has a positive association with most occupational, educational, health, and social outcomes later in life. Most effects were characterized by a moderate to strong linear trend or a practically null effect (mean R               2               range = .002–.256). Nearly all nonlinear effects were practically insignificant in magnitude (mean incremental R               2               = .001) or were not replicated across cohorts or survey waves. We found no support for any downside to higher ability and no evidence for a threshold beyond which greater scores cease to be beneficial. Thus, greater cognitive ability is generally advantageous—and virtually never detrimental.},

General intelligence (g) is situated at the top, under which are a group of broad intelligences such as verbal, visuospatial processing, and quantitative knowledge that pertain to more specific areas of reasoning. Some broad intelligences are people-centered, including personal, emotional, and social intelligences; others concern reasoning about things more generally, such as visuospatial and quantitative knowledge. In the present research, we conducted a meta-analysis of 87 studies, including 2322 effect sizes, to examine the average correlation between people-to-people intelligences relative to the average correlation between people-to-thing-centered intelligences (and similar comparisons). Results clearly support the psychometric distinction between people-centered and thing-centered mental abilities. Coupled with evidence for incremental predictions from people-centered intelligences, our findings provide a secure foundation for continued research focused on people-centered mental abilities.},

  abstract = {The Woodcock-Johnson IV Tests of Cognitive Abilities (WJ IV COG) is a comprehensive assessment battery designed to assess broad and narrow cognitive abilities, as defined by the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) theory of intelligence. Previous studies examined the invariance of the WJ assessments across sex and age groups using factor analytic methods. Psychometric network modeling is an alternative methodology that can address both direct and indirect relationships among the observed variables. In this study, we employed psychometric network modeling to examine the invariance of the WJ IV COG across sex and age groups. Using a normative sample (n = 4212 participants) representative of the United States population, we tested the extent to which the factorial structure of the WJ IV COG aligned with CHC theory for the school-aged sample. Next, we used psychometric network modeling as a data-driven method to investigate whether the network structure of the WJ IV COG remains similar across different sex and age (age 6 to 19, inclusively) groups. Our results showed that the WJ IV COG maintained the same network structure across all age and sex groups, although the network structure at younger ages indicated weaker relationships among some subtests. Overall, the results provide construct validity evidence for the WJ IV COG, based on both theoretical and data-driven methods.},

  abstract = {Multitasking is ubiquitous in everyday life, which means there is value in developing measures that predict successful multitasking performance. In a large sample (N\,=\,404 contributing data), we examined the predictive and incremental validity of placekeeping, which is the ability to perform a sequence of operations in a certain order without omissions or repetitions. In the context of multitasking, placekeeping should play a role in the performance of procedural subtasks and the interleaving of subtasks that interrupt each other. Regression analyses revealed that placekeeping ability accounted for 11\% of the variance in multitasking performance, and had incremental validity relative to each of a diverse set of cognitive abilities (working memory capacity, fluid intelligence, perceptual speed, and crystallized intelligence). The predictive validity of placekeeping for multitasking was stable across samples of performance and robust to placekeeping practice. Broader measures of performance on our placekeeping task accounted for 21\% of the variance in multitasking performance and had incremental validity relative to an estimate of psychometric g. The results provide evidence that placekeeping is a distinct cognitive ability with its own specific role to play in multitasking, and raise the possibility that measures of placekeeping ability could have utility in selecting personnel for occupations that require certain kinds of multitasking, such as interleaving of procedures.},

  abstract = {The question of what cognitive processes contribute to fluid intelligence (Gf)—the ability to solve novel problems—continues to be central in intelligence research. Here, we considered the contribution of placekeeping, which is the ability to perform a sequence of steps in a prescribed order without omissions or repetitions. Placekeeping plays a role in problem solving but also rests on the ability to remember past performance, so it may simply reduce to working memory capacity (WMC). To investigate this possibility, we evaluated whether placekeeping accounts for individual differences in Gf above and beyond WMC. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that placekeeping ability accounted for 12\% of the variance in Gf above and beyond WMC. By contrast, WMC accounted for only 2\% of the variance in Gf above and beyond placekeeping ability. Structural equation modeling revealed that placekeeping ability and WMC are distinct at the latent variable level, and together they accounted for 77\% of the variance in Gf. However, whereas placekeeping ability significantly predicted Gf in the structural equation model, WMC did not. In general, the results suggest that placekeeping ability is distinct from WMC and contributes substantially to individual differences in Gf.}

They examine the evidence for Matthew effects in reading and vocabulary between ages 8 and 11 in groups of children identified with good and poor reading comprehension at 8 years. They also investigate evidence for Matthew effects in reading and vocabulary between 8 and 16 years, in the larger sample. The poor comprehenders showed reduced growth in vocabulary compared to the good comprehenders, but not in word reading or reading comprehension ability. They also obtained lower scores on measures of out-of-school literacy. Analyses of the whole sample revealed that initial levels of reading experience and reading comprehension predicted vocabulary at ages 11, 14, and 16 after controlling for general ability and vocabulary skills when aged 8. The authors discuss these findings in relation to the influence of reading on vocabulary development.},

Environmental exposures to lead, predominantly from contaminated water or lead paint chips, account for the majority of exposures to children. In utero and early life exposures to lead have been associated with lower IQ, antisocial and delinquent behaviors, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. In this review, we will discuss sources of developmental lead exposure and mechanisms of lead neurotoxicity. We will highlight both human epidemiological studies showing associations between lead exposure and behavioral abnormalities as well as experimental data from animal studies. Finally, we will discuss the effects of lead on neurological endpoint past childhood, namely, development of Alzheimer's disease in old age.},

Results                                EFA                 did not support a theoretically posited fifth factor because only one subtest (Matrix Reasoning) had a salient pattern coefficient on the fifth factor. A model with four group factors and a general intelligence factor resembling the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children – Fourth Edition (                 WISC                 ‐                 IV                 ; Wechsler, 2003, Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children‐Fourth Edition, Psychological Corporation, San Antonio, TX, USA) was supported by both                 EFA                 and                 CFA                 . General intelligence (                 g                 ) was the dominant source of subtest variance and large omega‐hierarchical coefficients supported interpretation of the Full Scale                 IQ                 (                 FSIQ                 ) score. In contrast, the four group factors accounted for small portions of subtest variance and low omega‐hierarchical subscale coefficients indicated that the four‐factor index scores were of questionable interpretive value independent of                 g                 .

  abstract = {Interest measurement approaches to guidance are often used in Australian schools. These approaches assume that the measures are relevant to Australians, that the students are sufficiently mature to express interests that have some degree of stability, and that these interests will bear some relationship to the futures of the students. To investigate the truth of these assumptions, eight cohorts (i.e., groups) of female secondary school students completed the Career Assessment Inventory (CAI; Johansson, 1982). Data were collected 3 years later for each cohort, together with college course desti nations. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) was used to investigate the structure of interests of the students within groups identified by course destination. A three-dimensional solution indicates a strong relationship between interests and course destination using Holland's (1985) vocational theory and an empirical course cluster typology (Elsworth, Harvey-Beavis, Gilding, \& Briant, 1986).},

  abstract = {Reading comprehension is an incredibly complex, purposeful activity that involves simultaneous orchestration and integration of multiple processes. However, dominant perspectives suggest that two clusters of skills, word reading and language comprehension, account for successful reading. Such two-factor models are problematic because they do not easily account for complexities in reading comprehension processes or for contributions to reading comprehension of other individual difference variables related to the purposeful nature of reading, such as executive functions (EFs) and intrinsic motivation. Further, simple models may lead to oversimplification of research questions, curricula, and instructional practices, causing researchers and educators to miss important contributors to reading comprehension necessary for students to develop into skilled readers. In this study, the authors assessed the unique contributions of EFs, both domain-general and reading-specific, and cognitive intrinsic motivation (i.e., the desire to engage in effortful cognitive activities) to reading comprehension in 122 university students beyond language comprehension and word-reading skills. Findings confirm unique contributions of cognitive intrinsic motivation and reading-specific EF to students’ reading comprehension beyond established predictors and domain-general EFs. Findings also suggest complexities, such as impacts of language comprehension on word reading, as well as impacts of cognitive intrinsic motivation on both language and reading comprehension, that should be considered in theory and practice. Finally, because reading-specific EF contributed to reading comprehension directly and indirectly beyond controls, these findings underscore the importance of applying knowledge of EF to specific reading processes to better support students who struggle to understand text.},

Near-transfer effects of EF interventions are more common than far-transfer to academic skills. Thus, we assessed near- and far-transfer effects for intervention (n\,=\,29) and control (n\,=\,28) children. The reading-specific EF intervention produced medium to large effects on reading-specific and domain-general EF skills as well as on researcher-administered and school-administered reading comprehension measures, even after grade level (and thus reading teacher), verbal ability, children’s age, and respective pretest scores were controlled. These findings underscore the importance of translational work that takes researcher-tested interventions into real-world contexts to support children’s development. Implications of findings for practice are discussed.},

  abstract = {Mental disorders traditionally have been viewed as distinct, episodic, and categorical conditions. This view has been challenged by evidence that many disorders are sequentially comorbid, recurrent/chronic, and exist on a continuum. Using the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, we examined the structure of psychopathology, taking into account dimensionality, persistence, co-occurrence, and sequential comorbidity of mental disorders across 20 years, from adolescence to midlife. Psychiatric disorders were initially explained by three higher-order factors (Internalizing, Externalizing, and Thought Disorder) but explained even better with one General Psychopathology dimension. We have called this dimension the p factor because it conceptually parallels a familiar dimension in psychological science: the g factor of general intelligence. Higher p scores are associated with more life impairment, greater familiality, worse developmental histories, and more compromised early-life brain function. The p factor explains why it is challenging to find causes, consequences, biomarkers, and treatments with specificity to individual mental disorders. Transdiagnostic approaches may improve research.},

We review the history of the idea that all mental disorders share something in common, p; how we arrived at this idea; and how it became conflated with a statistical representation, the bifactor model. We then leverage data from the Environmental Risk Longitudinal Twin Study to examine the properties and nomological network of different statistical representations of p. We found that p performed similarly regardless of how it was modeled, suggesting that if the sample and content are the same, the resulting p factor will be similar. We suggest that the meaning of p is not to be found by dueling over statistical models but by conducting well-specified criterion-validation studies and developing new measurement approaches. We outline new directions to refresh research efforts to uncover what all mental disorders have in common.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Digital drawing tests have been proposed for cognitive screening over the past decade. However, the diagnostic performance is still to clarify. The objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance among different types of digital and paper-and-pencil drawing tests in the screening of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Diagnostic studies evaluating digital or paper-and-pencil drawing tests for the screening of MCI or dementia were identified from OVID databases, included Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. Studies evaluated any type of drawing tests for the screening of MCI or dementia and compared with healthy controls. This study was performed according to PRISMA and the guidelines proposed by the Cochrane Diagnostic Test Accuracy Working Group. A bivariate random-effects model was used to compare the diagnostic performance of these drawing tests and presented with a summary receiver-operating characteristic curve. The primary outcome was the diagnostic performance of clock drawing test (CDT). Other types of drawing tests were the secondary outcomes. A total of 90 studies with 22,567 participants were included. In the screening of MCI, the pooled sensitivity and specificity of the digital CDT was 0.86 (95\% CI\,=\,0.75 to 0.92) and 0.92 (95\% CI\,=\,0.69 to 0.98), respectively. For the paper-and-pencil CDT, the pooled sensitivity and specificity of brief scoring method was 0.63 (95\% CI\,=\,0.49 to 0.75) and 0.77 (95\% CI\,=\,0.68 to 0.84), and detailed scoring method was 0.63 (95\% CI\,=\,0.56 to 0.71) and 0.72 (95\% CI\,=\,0.65 to 0.78). In the screening of dementia, the pooled sensitivity and specificity of the digital CDT was 0.83 (95\% CI\,=\,0.72 to 0.90) and 0.87 (95\% CI\,=\,0.79 to 0.92). The performances of the digital and paper-and-pencil pentagon drawing tests were comparable in the screening of dementia. The digital CDT demonstrated better diagnostic performance than paper-and-pencil CDT for MCI. Other types of digital drawing tests showed comparable performance with paper-and-pencil formats. Therefore, digital drawing tests can be used as an alternative tool for the screening of MCI and dementia.},

Reliability coefficients have long been denoted using names that are unrelated to each other, with each formula being generated through different methods, and they have been represented inconsistently. Such inconsistency prevents organizational researchers from understanding the whole picture and misleads them into using coefficient alpha unconditionally. This study provides a systematic naming convention, formula-generating methods, and methods of representing each of the reliability coefficients. This study offers an easy-to-use solution to the issue of choosing between coefficient alpha and composite reliability. This study introduces a calculator that enables its users to obtain the values of various multidimensional reliability coefficients with a few mouse clicks. This study also presents illustrative numerical examples to provide a better understanding of the characteristics and computations of reliability coefficients.},

Genetic influences on five prereading skills (print knowledge, rapid naming, phonological awareness, vocabulary, and verbal memory) were primarily responsible for relations with word reading and spelling. However, relations with post-fourth-grade reading comprehension were due to both genetic and shared environmental influences. Genetic and shared environmental influences that were common among the prereading variables covaried with reading and spelling, as did genetic influences unique to verbal memory (only post-fourth-grade comprehension), print knowledge, and rapid naming.},

This study investigates the construct validity among four major interest inventories—the Self-Directed Search (SDS), O*NET Interest Profiler (IP), ACT Interest Inventory (UNIACT), and Strong Interest Inventory (SII). Results showed that RIASEC interest scores from the four inventories were highly correlated, but the measures often gave respondents different high-point codes. Item content analysis revealed that the basic interests reflected in each RIASEC scale both overlapped and diverged across inventories, providing an explanation for why RIASEC inventories are not interchangeable. We integrate findings across our analyses to offer cautionary notes for choosing among established RIASEC inventories and interpreting interest results. Furthermore, we also provide recommendations for constructing the next generation of basic interest inventories.},

  abstract = {Introduction                                The UK Biobank cognitive assessment data has been a significant resource for researchers looking to investigate predictors and modifiers of cognitive abilities and associated health outcomes in the general population. Given the diverse nature of this data, researchers use different approaches – from the use of a single test to composing the general intelligence score,                 g                 , across the tests. We argue that both approaches are suboptimal - one being too specific and the other one too general – and suggest a novel multifactorial solution to represent cognitive abilities.                                                        Methods               Using a combined Exploratory Factor (EFA) and Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling Analyses (ESEM) we developed a three-factor model to characterize an underlying structure of nine cognitive tests selected from the UK Biobank using a Cattell-Horn-Carroll framework. We first estimated a series of probable factor solutions using the maximum likelihood method of extraction. The best solution for the EFA-defined factor structure was then tested using the ESEM approach with the aim of confirming or disconfirming the decisions made.                                         Results                                We determined that a three-factor model fits the UK Biobank cognitive assessment data best. Two of the three factors can be assigned to                 fluid reasoning (Gf)                 with a clear distinction between                 visuospatial reasoning                 and                 verbal-analytical reasoning                 . The third factor was identified as a                 processing speed (Gs)                 factor.                                                        Discussion                                This study characterizes cognitive assessment data in the UK Biobank and delivers an alternative view on its underlying structure, suggesting that the three factor model provides a more granular solution than                 g                 that can further be applied to study different facets of cognitive functioning in relation to health outcomes and to further progress examination of its biological underpinnings.},

However, recent evidence suggests these increased scores are coming to an end in some world regions. Here we compare two cohorts of university freshmen. The first cohort (n = 311) was assessed in 1991, whereas the second cohort (n = 349) was assessed thirty years later (2022). These cohorts completed the same intelligence battery including eight standardized speeded and power tests tapping reasoning (abstract and quantitative), language (vocabulary, verbal comprehension, and verbal meanings), rote calculation, and visuospatial relations. The results revealed a global gain of 3.5 IQ points but also upward and downward changes at the test level. The 2022 cohort outperformed the 1991 cohort on reasoning (abstract and quantitative), verbal comprehension, and vocabulary, whereas the 1991 cohort outscored the 2022 cohort on rote calculation, visuospatial relations (mental rotation and identical figures), and verbal meanings. These findings are thought to support one key claim made by James Flynn: generational changes on the specific cognitive abilities and skills tapped by standardized tests should be expected without appreciable or substantive changes in the structure of the intelligence construct identified within generations. This main conclusion is discussed with respect to theoretical causal implications putatively derived from current intelligence psychometric models.},

The goal was to assess the specificity hypothesis, in which unexpected underachievement associated with LD is represented in terms of distinctive patterns of cognitive and academic strengths and weaknesses. At the start of 3rd grade, the authors assessed 684 students on five cognitive dimensions (nonverbal problem solving, processing speed, concept formation, language, and working memory), and across Grades 3 through 5, the authors assessed performance in each academic area three to four times. Based on final intercept, the authors classified students as LD or not LD in each of the four academic areas. For each of these four LD variables, they conducted multivariate cognitive profile analysis and academic profile analysis. Results, which generally supported the specificity hypothesis, are discussed in terms of the potential connections between reading and mathematics LD.},

Methods               Our sample comprised 288 patients with Parkinson’s disease (179 men and 109 women). The mean age of participants was 66.66 (SD~=~8.93). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to evaluate the test developers’ five-factor model of the ACE-R, and alternative models as guided by the Cattell–Horn–Carroll (CHC) theory. Exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) was also employed to examine alternative factor structures to ensure that a good candidate model was not overlooked.                                         Results               A three-factor CHC-guided CFA and a similar three-factor ESEM model both showed acceptable overall fit, and interpretable factor structures. The three-factor CFA model showed two factors of pure CHC constructs: acquired knowledge (Gc), and visuospatial ability (Gv), and one combined factor, namely, long-term memory retrieval, fluency, and working memory (Glr-Gsm). The three-factor ESEM model showed three factors essentially in line with the CFA results.

  abstract = {Process overlap theory (POT) is a new theoretical framework designed to account for the general factor of intelligence (g). According to POT, g does not reflect a general cognitive ability. Instead, g is the result of multiple domain-general executive attention processes and multiple domain-specific processes that are sampled in an overlapping manner across a battery of intelligence tests. POT explains several benchmark findings on human intelligence. However, the precise nature of the executive attention processes underlying g remains unclear. In the current paper, we discuss challenges associated with building a theory of individual differences in attention and intelligence. We argue that the conflation of psychological theories and statistical models, as well as problematic inferences based on latent variables, impedes research progress and prevents theory building. Two studies designed to illustrate the unique features of POT relative to previous approaches are presented. In Study 1, a simulation is presented to illustrate precisely how POT accounts for the relationship between executive attention processes and g. In Study 2, three datasets from previous studies are reanalyzed (N = 243, N = 234, N = 945) and reveal a discrepancy between the POT simulated model and the unity/diversity model of executive function. We suggest that this discrepancy is largely due to methodological problems in previous studies but also reflects different goals of research on individual differences in attention. The unity/diversity model is designed to facilitate research on executive function and dysfunction associated with cognitive and neural development and disease. POT is uniquely suited to guide and facilitate research on individual differences in cognitive ability and the investigation of executive attention processes underlying g.},

The article then reviews a follow-up confirmatory systematic review of this multilevel framework and the specific content of the 2015 revision of the MLG (Cook et al., 2015). The follow-up confirmatory review found that there is an uneven distribution in the quantity and quality of research on various forms of GBV, that the MLG’s domains and factors are relevant to consider when evaluating the risk for GBV, and that the revised version of the MLG had not omitted any strongly supported risk factors for GBV. Together, these reviews indicate the importance of using a comprehensive nested ecological framework in understanding, assessing, and managing risk for extremist violence and other forms of GBV. This article can guide practice and the ongoing development, review, and revision of all new and existing risk assessment tools for violent extremism and other forms of GBV.

Although relatively little attention has been paid to open science in relation to single-case design, we propose that open-science practices can be applied to enhance the credibility and impact of single-case design research. In this article, we discuss how open-science practices align with other recent developments in single-case design research, describe four prominent open-science practices (i.e., preregistration, registered reports, data and materials sharing, and open access), and discuss potential benefits and limitations of each practice for single-case design.},

These two dimensions are used to form what is identified as the space-time continuum, containing four quadrants: tight space and tight time, loose space and tight time, tight space and loose time, loose space and loose time. The intelligence and creativity constructs can be mapped onto the four quadrants and found to overlap more or less, depending on the context characteristics. Measurement methodologies adapted to the four different quadrants are discussed. The article concludes with a discussion about future research directions based on the proposed theoretical framework, in terms of theories and hypotheses on intelligence and creativity, of eminent personalities and personality traits, as well as its consequences for developmental, educational, and professional environments.},

Findings indicate that some cognitive abilities were stronger predictors of reading achievement than previously found (e.g., Gf, Ga, and Gs). Most notably, the Woodcock-Johnson–IV Gf cluster was found to be the strongest and most consistent predictor of reading achievement. A secondary analysis suggests that this effect was likely due to the new Number Series test. The results of the study suggest revisions to previous conceptualizations of the associations between the broad Cattell-Horn-Carroll abilities and areas of reading achievement.},

  abstract = {The topic of working memory (WM) is ubiquitous in research on cognitive psychology and on individual differences. According to one definition, it is a small amount of information kept in a temporary state of heightened accessibility; it is used in most types of communication and problem solving. Short-term storage has been defined as the passive (i.e., non-attention-based, nonstrategic) component of WM or, alternatively, as a passive store separate from an attention-based WM. Here I note that much confusion has been created by the use by various investigators of many, subtly different definitions of WM and short-term storage. The definitions are sometimes made explicit and sometimes implied. As I explain, the different definitions may have stemmed from the use of a wide variety of techniques to explore WM, along with differences in theoretical orientation. By delineating nine previously used definitions of WM and explaining how additional ones may emerge from combinations of these nine, I hope to improve scientific discourse on WM. The potential advantages of clarity about definitions of WM and short-term storage are illustrated with respect to several ongoing research controversies.},

However, he might be surprised at its survival, given the extent to which it has been undermined by the weight of currently available empirical evidence. The failure of this evidence to influence diagnostic practice reflects not only the comfortable simplicity of the dichotomous approach, but also the fact that this approach has for many years continued to receive support from some areas of research, particularly genetic epidemiology. This, however, is changing and findings from genetic epidemiology are being reappraised. More importantly, the potential of molecular genetics to indicate biological systems involved in psychopathology has been recognized, and with it the potential to develop diagnostic classifications that have greater biological validity. Crucially, this will facilitate diagnostic schemes with much greater clinical utility, allowing clinicians to select treatments based on underlying pathogenesis. Recent molecular genetic findings have demonstrated very clearly the inadequacies of the dichotomous view, and highlighted the importance of better classifying cases with both psychotic and affective symptoms. In this article we discuss these issues and suggest ways forward, both immediately and for DSM-V and ICD-11. If psychiatry is to translate the opportunities offered by new research methodologies, we must move to a classificatory approach that is worthy of the 21st century.},

In this study we investigated the extent to which executive function skills contribute to these three components of mathematical knowledge, whether this mediates the relationship between executive functions and overall mathematics achievement, and if these relationships change with age. Two hundred and ninety-three participants aged between 8 and 25years completed a large battery of mathematics and executive function tests. Domain-specific skills partially mediated the relationship between executive functions and mathematics achievement: Inhibitory control within the numerical domain was associated with factual knowledge and procedural skill, which in turn was associated with mathematical achievement. Working memory contributed to mathematics achievement indirectly through factual knowledge, procedural skill and, to a lesser extent, conceptual understanding. There remained a substantial direct pathway between working memory and mathematics achievement however, which may reflect the role of working memory in identifying and constructing problem representations. These relationships were remarkably stable from 8years through to young adulthood. Our findings help to refine existing multi-component frameworks of mathematics and understand the mechanisms by which executive functions support mathematics achievement.},

Additionally, the accuracies of the mean eigenvalue and the 95th percentile eigenvalue criteria were examined. The 95th percentile criterion was preferable for assessing the first eigenvalue using either extraction method. In assessing subsequent eigenvalues, PA-PCA tended to perform as well as or better than PA-PAF for models with one factor or multiple minimally correlated factors; the relative performance of the mean eigenvalue and the 95th percentile eigenvalue criteria depended on the number of variables per factor. PA-PAF using the mean eigenvalue criterion generally performed best if factors were more than minimally correlated or if one or more strong general factors as well as group factors were present.},

Results indicated that individuals who complied with instructions to underreport produced statistically significantly and meaningfully higher scores on the MMPI-2-RF underreporting Validity Scales (Uncommon Virtues [L-r] and Adjustment Validity [K-r]) when compared with those who received standard instructions and with individuals who did not comply with instructions to underreport. Moreover, in comparisons with both groups, participants who complied with instructions to underreport had lower scores on the majority of the substantive scales.

The major dependent variables in Study 1 were pretest to posttest changes following intervention on reading tests for word reading and word decoding. Other dependent variables comprised tests of phonological awareness, rapid naming speed, and cognitive tests of Planning, Attention, Successive, and Simultaneous processing (PASS). Results of Study 1 showed a significant improvement on both reading tasks following               inductive learning intervention               , among children below the median in comparison with those above the median. The               phonics-based program               resulted in similar improvement in only one of the reading tasks, word decoding. Results are discussed in terms of approaches to reading intervention for children with persistent reading difficulties. In Study 2, the important dependent variables were word reading and word decoding, as well as passage comprehension. Results showed that PREP participants evidenced continued improvements in their reading skills, notably in comprehension.},

This overview of contributions to intelligence research covers the first decade of the twenty-first century. There is a survey of some of the major books that appeared since 2000, at different levels of expertise and from different points of view. Contributions to the phenotype of intelligence differences are discussed, as well as some contributions to causes and consequences of intelligence differences. The major causal issues covered concern the environment and genetics, and how intelligence differences are being mapped to brain differences. The major outcomes discussed are health, education, and socioeconomic status. Aging and intelligence are discussed, as are sex differences in intelligence and whether twins and singletons differ in intelligence. More generally, the degree to which intelligence has become a part of broader research in neuroscience, health, and social science is discussed.},

A further evaluation is provided by an empirical evaluation that compares statistical estimates using different approaches in a large sample of children (ages 9–13 years, N = 780) administered a comprehensive battery of cognitive measures. Results from this study demonstrate the ramifications of using the bifactor and Schmid–Leiman (BF/SL) technique and suggest that using BF/SL methods limit interpretation of cognitive abilities to only a general factor. The inadvertent use of BF/SL methods is demonstrated to impact both model dimensionality and variance estimates for specific measures. As demonstrated in this study, conclusions from both exploratory and confirmatory studies using BF/SL methods are significantly questioned, especially for studies with a questionable theoretical basis. Guidelines for the interpretation of cognitive test scores in applied practice are discussed.},

  abstract = {Studies on human reasoning have long established that intuitions can bias inference and lead to violations of logical norms. Popular dual-process models, which characterize thinking as an interaction between intuitive (System 1) and deliberate (System 2) thought processes, have presented an appealing explanation for this observation. According to this account, logical reasoning is traditionally considered as a prototypical example of a task that requires effortful deliberate thinking. In recent years, however, a number of findings obtained with new experimental paradigms have brought into question the traditional dual-process characterization. A key observation is that people can process logical principles in classic reasoning tasks intuitively and without deliberation. We review the paradigms and sketch how this work is leading to the development of revised dual-process models.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the accuracy of clinical diagnosis of Down syndrome, identify problems in reaching a diagnosis, to provide recommendations for improvement and estimate a minimum prevalence for all types of Down syndrome. DESIGN: A retrospective observational study was carried out over a five-year period. Genesis, a database located in the Department of Medical genetics, was used to identify the number of Down syndrome karyotypes including trisomy, translocation, and mosaic sample variants. Age of diagnosis was determined using date of receipt. Karyotyping requests for a clinical diagnosis of Down syndrome were also identified. Patient notes and cytogenetic laboratory reports were used to identify clinical indication for karyotyping. SETTING: Regional Genetics Centre, covering all cytogenetic analyses for referrals within the entire Northern Ireland population. RESULTS: 208 postnatal cases of Down syndrome were identified, 197 (94.7\%) trisomy, 3 (1.45\%) translocation, and 8 (3.85\%) mosaic variants. 112 (54.8\%) were male and 96 (46.2\%) female. 268 samples were taken to confirm or exclude a clinical diagnosis of Down syndrome. 185 of these had Down syndrome, 77 were normal, and 6 had another abnormality. 90\% and 100\% of trisomy and translocation Down syndrome respectively were diagnosed on the basis of clinical features. This fell to 37.5\% of mosaic Down syndrome patients being diagnosed clinically (p {$<$} 0.001). Simian crease, sandal gap, epicanthic folds, hypotonia, upslanting palpebral fissures, and protruding tongue are the most frequent characteristic features seen. Similarly epicanthic folds, protruding tongue, simian crease and sandal gap, hypotonia, and upslanting palpebral fissures are also described in a significant proportion of karyotypically normal individuals, thus arousing a suspicion of Down syndrome. 89.4\% of patients were diagnosed between day 1 and 7 of life. Of 10.6\% patients diagnosed after day 7 of life, 7.6\% were adults and 3\% children. The minimum prevalence was estimated at 167.9 per 100,000, or 1 in 595 births. CONCLUSION: In a defined population, with a prevalence of around 1 in 600 births, accurate clinical diagnosis occurred in 90\%, 100\%, and 37.5\% of trisomy, translocation, and mosaic patients. 49.5\% of patients had one or more of the following phenotypic findings: Simian crease, sandal gap, epicanthic folds, hypotonia, upslanting palpebral fissures, and protruding tongue. However, the same six features aroused a suspicion of Down syndrome in individuals with normal karyotyping, thus causing undue stress and worry to parents. Mosaic cases may be more common than previously recognised, and often do not have dysmorphic features. It is therefore a diagnosis that should always be considered in those who are educationally subnormal without a definitive diagnosis.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To review the reliability and validity of the CAGE questionnaire across different patient populations and discuss its role in the detection of alcohol-related problems.  Methods: The Cochrane Database for Systematic Reviews, Medline, Embase, and Psychinfo were searched. No systematic reviews were found on the Cochrane Database.  Search of the other databases yielded one systematic review and one meta-analysis, on different aspects of CAGE.  Three articles on reliability and 16 on validity of CAGE were found and used.  Studies generally yielded Level II evidence.   Results: CAGE has demonstrated high test-retest reliability (0.80-0.95), and adequate correlations (0.48-0.70) with other screening instruments. The questionnaire is a valid tool for detecting alcohol abuse and dependence in medical and surgical inpatients, ambulatory medical patients, and psychiatric inpatients (average sensitivity 0.71, specificity 0.90). Its performance in primary care patients has been varied, while it has not performed well in white women, prenatal women, and college students. Furthermore, it is not an appropriate screening test for less severe forms of drinking.       Conclusions: CAGE is short, feasible to use, and easily applied in clinical practice.  However, users should be aware of its limitations when interpreting the results.  A positive screen should be followed by a proper diagnostic evaluation using standard clinical criteria.}

  abstract = {Abstract             The simple view of reading proposes that the development of reading comprehension in early elementary school is best predicted by children’s fluent decoding and oral language skills. Recent studies challenge this view and suggest that executive functions should also be included in this theoretical model; however, the empirical evidence is not strong enough to clearly support or refute this hypothesis. In this short-term longitudinal study, we used latent variables to test whether executive functions have direct effects on the development of reading comprehension in 184 Romanian second graders, beyond fluent decoding and oral language skills. The results indicated that the initial stages of reading comprehension were associated with executive functions, but only the language skills could independently predict the development of reading comprehension. Our findings show that executive functions do not have a significant direct effect on the development of reading comprehension in early readers beyond fluent decoding and oral language skills in languages with transparent orthography. The results also suggest that once children learn to decode well, their language skills (and not their executive functions) have a strong effect on the development of reading comprehension. Therefore, reading interventions in elementary school should stress on the development of oral language skills.},

Despite these changes, the Technical Handbook did not report results from exploratory factor analytic investigations, and confirmatory factor analyses were implemented using selected subtests across the normative age groups from the total battery. To address these omissions, the present study investigated the theoretical structure of the DAS-II using principal axis factoring followed by the Schmid–Leiman procedure with participants from the 5- to 8-year-old age range to determine the degree to which the DAS-II theoretical structure proposed in the Technical Handbook could be replicated. Unlike other age ranges investigated where at most 14 subtests were administered, the entire DAS-II battery was normed on participants aged 5 to 8 years, making it well suited to test the full instrument’s alignment with theory. Results suggested a six-factor solution that was essentially consistent with the Cattell–Horn–Carroll (CHC)-based theoretical structure suggested by the test publisher and simple structure was attained. The only exception involved two subtests (Picture Similarities and Early Number Concepts) that did not saliently load on a group factor. Implications for clinical practice are discussed.},

The WIAT-4 is one of the more commonly administered broadband measures of academic achievement. The instrument was determined to be well-conceptualized, and generally psychometrically sound. Omissions include factor analyses to determine the instrument’s theoretical and scoring structure, and the lack of presentation of item analysis results. Importantly, the Essay Composition subtest is now much easier to score which should serve to increase interest in the WIAT-4 as a viable option for the assessment of academic achievement. Although there are a number of subtests beyond the core battery to administer, users may find that the time and effort required to administer those subtests are worth the effort given the rich detail furnished that is linked to scientific literature regarding the etiology of learning disabilities.},

The Technical Manual does not furnish validity evidence for the scores reported by the scoring system, suggesting that evidentiary support may be incomplete. Exploratory bifactor analysis (EBFA; maximum likelihood extraction with a bigeomin [orthogonal] rotation) was applied to the two school-aged correlation matrices at ages 9 to 19. Results indicated nonalignment with CHC theory and do not support the interpretation of most of the scores suggested by the scoring system. Instead, the results of this study suggest that the loading patterns diverge significantly from the interpretive system produced by the WJ IV ACH. Only the academic fluency and academic knowledge clusters emerged following the use of EBFA. Implications for clinical interpretation of the WJ IV ACH are offered.},

Although methods for characterizing the accuracy of decisions based on a single measure have been suggested by numerous researchers, such methods are not useful for estimating the accuracy of decisions based on multiple measures. This study presents a simulation method useful for estimating classification accuracy for any measurement model and complex decision rule. The utility of the method is demonstrated by application to actual data from General Educational Development (GED) test takers. Findings in this study illustrate how multiple scores that are combined can have a large impact on the accuracy of the resulting decision. Furthermore, choice of measure of agreement is of central importance in describing decision accuracy.},

It has been proposed that individual differences in word reading could affect the rate of vocabulary growth, mediated by the amount of reading experience, a process referred to as a                 Matthew effect                 (Stanovich, 1986).                                                        Method                                In the current study, assessments of written word–reading skills in the 4th grade and oral vocabulary knowledge collected in kindergarten and in the 4th, 8th, and 10th grades from a large epidemiologically based sample (                 n                 = 485) allowed a test of the relationship of early word-reading skills and the subsequent rate of vocabulary growth.                                                        Results               Consistent with the hypothesis, multilevel modeling revealed the rate of vocabulary growth after the 4th grade to be significantly related to 4th-grade word reading after controlling for kindergarten vocabulary level, that is, above average readers experienced a higher rate of vocabulary growth than did average readers.                                         Conclusions               Vocabulary growth rate differences accumulated over time such that the effect on vocabulary size was large.},

The simple view is a useful tool for conveying the undeniable importance—in fact, the necessity—of both decoding and linguistic comprehension for reading. Research in the 35 years since the theory was proposed has revealed additional understandings about reading. In this article, we synthesize research documenting three of these advances: (1) Reading difficulties have a number of causes, not all of which fall under decoding and/or listening comprehension as posited in the simple view; (2) rather than influencing reading solely independently, as conceived in the simple view, decoding and listening comprehension (or in terms more commonly used in reference to the simple view today, word recognition and language comprehension) overlap in important ways; and (3) there are many contributors to reading not named in the simple view, such as active, self‐regulatory processes, that play a substantial role in reading. We point to research showing that instruction aligned with these advances can improve students’ reading. We present a theory, which we call the active view of reading, that is an expansion of the simple view and can be used to convey these important advances to current and future educators. We discuss the need to lift up updated theories and models to guide practitioners’ work in supporting students’ reading development in classrooms and interventions.},

  abstract = {Scholars have lamented that current methods of assessing student performance do not align with contemporary views of learning as situated within students, contexts, and time. Here, we introduce and describe one theoretical–psychometric paradigm—termed dynamic measurement—designed to provide a valid representation of the way students respond to school-based instruction by estimating the learning potential of those students given their observed learning trajectory. We examine the century-long history of dynamic measurement, from its nascent theoretical beginnings, through its limited initial implementations, to the current development of a specialized modeling framework that allows it to be applied to large-scale educational data. We illustrate how dynamic measurement models (DMMs) can realize the goals of modern theory and measurement using a large longitudinal dataset of mathematics assessment data (i.e., 11,368 students nested within 98 schools and measured at 6 time points). These historical review and methodological demonstrations show the value of dynamic measurement, including better modeling of complex and contextually dependent influences on student learning.}

Using strict criteria regarding quality of the sample and the study, we found nine studies reporting negative Flynn Effects in seven countries. We also discuss several possible explanations for the negative Flynn Effect as an attempt to understand its most probable causes.}

  abstract = {Background               DSM-5 may mark the shift from a categorical classification of personality pathology to a dimensional system. Although dimensional and categorical conceptualizations of personality pathology are often viewed as competing, it is possible to develop categories (prototypes) from combinations of dimensions. Robust prototypes could bridge dimensions and categories within a single classification system.                                         Method                                To explore prototype structure and robustness, we used finite mixture modeling to identify empirically derived personality pathology prototypes within a large sample (                 n                 =8690) of individuals from four settings (clinical, college, community, and military), assessed using a dimensional measure of normal and abnormal personality traits, the Schedule for Nonadaptive and Adaptive Personality (SNAP). We then examined patterns of convergent and discriminant external validity for prototypes. Finally, we investigated the robustness of the dimensional structure of personality pathology.                                                        Results               The resulting prototypes were meaningful (externally valid) but non-robust (sample dependent). By contrast, factor analysis revealed that the dimensional structures underlying specific traits were highly robust across samples.                                         Conclusions               We interpret these results as further evidence of the fundamentally dimensional nature of an empirically based classification of personality pathology.},

However, critics argue that in place of the quick thinking envisaged by nudge behaviour change reflects deeper and broader thought processes. One of these patterns of thinking – fatalism – has been identified across health and allied disciplines as key to explaining the reason why many people ignore authoritative advice. Insights drawn from a critical review of the fatalism literature explain why nudges sometimes fail. While a fatalist mindset seems to make some of us more susceptible to nudges, it prompts others to respond to nudges in surprising and dysfunctional ways.}

  abstract = {Abstract             A growing number of publications focus on estimating Gaussian graphical models (GGM, networks of partial correlation coefficients). At the same time, generalizibility and replicability of these highly parameterized models are debated, and sample sizes typically found in datasets may not be sufficient for estimating the underlying network structure. In addition, while recent work emerged that aims to compare networks based on different samples, these studies do not take potential cross-study heterogeneity into account. To this end, this paper introduces methods for estimating GGMs by aggregating over multiple datasets. We first introduce a general maximum likelihood estimation modeling framework in which all discussed models are embedded. This modeling framework is subsequently used to introduce meta-analytic Gaussian network aggregation (MAGNA). We discuss two variants: fixed-effects MAGNA, in which heterogeneity across studies is not taken into account, and random-effects MAGNA, which models sample correlations and takes heterogeneity into account. We assess the performance of MAGNA in large-scale simulation studies. Finally, we exemplify the method using four datasets of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and summarize findings from a larger meta-analysis of PTSD symptom.},

  abstract = {Meehl argued in 1978 that theories in psychology come and go, with little cumulative progress. We believe that this assessment still holds, as also evidenced by increasingly common claims that psychology is facing a “theory crisis” and that psychologists should invest more in theory building. In this article, we argue that the root cause of the theory crisis is that developing good psychological theories is extremely difficult and that understanding the reasons why it is so difficult is crucial for moving forward in the theory crisis. We discuss three key reasons based on philosophy of science for why developing good psychological theories is so hard: the relative lack of robust phenomena that impose constraints on possible theories, problems of validity of psychological constructs, and obstacles to discovering causal relationships between psychological variables. We conclude with recommendations on how to move past the theory crisis.},

Large groups of normal men and women, and of male and female students, were administered an inventory containing 106 potential P, E and N items, and the results analysed in detail. It emerges that P, E and N factors are found, as predicted, in the factor analysis of the data; that reliable scales can be constructed from the available items for P; and that the factors found are relatively invariant from one sex to the other, and from one sample to others. It appears that N and P are not entirely independent, but correlate to a moderate extent. It is suggested that P might be a personality variable of interest in connexion with many experimental investigations; that it might determine differential performance, either alone or in conjunction with E and/or N; and that experimental studies of P in normal subjects might throw much needed light on the nature and meaning of psychoticism as a personality variable.},

De-implementation of discredited and low-value practices is a necessary step for school psychologists’ maintenance of evidence-based practices and to reduce unnecessary costs and risk. However, efforts to clarify de-implementation frameworks and strategies are ongoing. The scope of this paper follows McKay et al. in considering the potential for de-implementation strategies to be informed by applied behavior analysis and operant learning theory. We conceptualize low-value practice as sets of behaviors evoked by their context and maintained by their consequences, and thus de-implementation as behavior reduction. We discuss the need for future research given this perspective.},

To provide insight on this dilemma, this article presents the results of a content analyses of available interpretive resources in the clinical assessment literature that may shed insight on this issue. Although previous reviews have evaluated the content of individual assessment courses, this is the first systematic review of pedagogical resources frequently adopted in reading lists by course instructors. The interpretive guidance offered across tests within these texts was largely homogenous emphasizing the primary interpretation of subscale scores, de-emphasizing interpretation of global composites (i.e., FSIQ), and advocating for the use of some variant of profile analysis to interpret scores and score profiles. Implications for advancing evidence-based assessment in school psychology training and guarding against unwarranted unsupported claims in clinical assessment is discussed.},

The origins of these problems are linked to the historical development of the profession which has provided school psychologists with a unique and distinctive role in administering IQ tests and using the results to make decisions about special educational provision for children with learning difficulties. This article reviews recent research that is heavily critical of the relevance of IQ testing and the associated medical model of working, and then considers some of the barriers which prevent school psychologists from changing their practices. It concludes with suggestions as to how the profession can move forward with confidence, knowing that it can make a distinctive contribution to supporting vulnerable children, schools and communities around the world.},

This review evaluates empirical evidence regarding the reliability and validity of this widely used screening instrument.                                         Methods{$\quad$}               Source documents were 36 peer‐reviewed reports yielding data regarding the SASSI's internal consistency, test–retest reliability, psychometric structure, convergent and divergent validity and criterion (predictive) validity.                                         Results{$\quad$}               The total               N               of the studies reviewed equaled 22{$\quad$}110. Internal consistency is high for the overall SASSI and for its direct but not its indirect (subtle) subscales, suggesting that the instrument taps a single face‐valid construct. SASSI classifications converged with those from other direct screening instruments, and were also correlated with ethnicity, general distress and social deviance. Studies found test–retest reliability lower than that reported in the test manuals. Sensitivity was found to be similar to that for public domain screening instruments, but on specificity the SASSI appears to yield a high rate of false positives.                                         Conclusion{$\quad$}               No empirical evidence was found for the SASSI's claimed unique advantage in detecting substance use disorders through its indirect (subtle) scales to circumvent respondent denial or dishonesty. Recommendations for screening and for future research with the SASSI are offered.},

However, it is not known whether this reading gap persists into adult life. In this report we use an epidemiologic sample of 312 children (typical readers\,=\,246; dyslexic readers\,=\,66), followed longitudinally from age 5 through adulthood and examine two fundamental questions: 1) Is reading level in 1               st               grade predictive of reading proficiency in adulthood in typical and dyslexic readers? and 2) Are the               trajectories               of reading development from 1               st               through 5               th               grade predictive of reading proficiency in adulthood in typical and dyslexic readers? Our findings indicate that early reading levels in 1               st               grade as well as the trajectory of reading development through the first five years of school were associated with reading scores in adulthood. This association was stronger for dyslexic than for typical readers, especially the latter factor. These findings indicate that the achievement gap between typical and dyslexic readers persists far beyond adolescence, in fact, into adult life.},

The influence function, a widely used tool in robust estimation, is easily computed for quantiles, as well as for other distributional statistics. Our approach, thus, can be readily generalized to other distributional statistics.}

  abstract = {The Cognitive Interview (CI) was designed initially to assist police to elicit more information from witnesses to crime by incorporating principles of social dynamics, memory and cognition, and communication. As many of these underlying psychological processes are also critical for people recalling other, non-criminal events (e.g., accidents), we adapted the CI to be used to assist people to remember a variety of experiences. The chapter reviews much of the empirical testing of the CI in such non-criminal experiences: car and industrial accidents, blood donations, earlier conversations, public health events, hostage-takings, etc. We describe both lab and field studies, and also include professional investigators’ descriptions of their experiences of using the CI in real-world investigations (e.g., debriefing hostages about their captors; interviewing a soldier about a military attack; interviewing an informant in a narcotics investigation). The chapter also describes using the CI to facilitate recalling past mental activities (e.g., decisions and emotions). We offer some suggestions about the kinds of investigation in which the CI is most likely and least likely to be effective. Finally, we make some critical comments about previous CI research and offer some suggestions about directions to take in the future},

  abstract = {Individual differences in cognitive control contribute to academic success, engagement, and persistence toward long-term goal achievement. In a prior study, we found that preschool working memory, a component of cognitive control, predicts kindergarten academic competence and classroom engagement. In the present study, we assess whether preschool working memory contributes to high school dropout risk at age 13. Participants are 1824 children from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development who were individually assessed at ages 2.5 and 3.5 on working memory using the Imitation Sorting Task. Dropout risk, representing an index, comprised of grade retention history and concurrent school performance and engagement, was measured in spring of grade 7. We used logistic regression to estimate dropout risk from early childhood working memory while controlling for verbal and non-verbal IQ, socioeconomic status, and sex. A one point increase in children's working memory skills predicted a 26\% reduction in the odds of being in the high risk group for dropout. Higher socioeconomic status and intellectual skills also predicted lower high school dropout risk. Individual differences in preschool working memory may contribute to early detection of later high school dropout risk. These results suggest the importance of further developing early effective interventions aimed at strengthening cognitive control in children.},

This study examined the contribution of executive function to comprehension of expository science text among adult readers, as well as the role of vocabulary ability in the relation between executive function and text comprehension. The roles of additional reader characteristics, including age, reading time, prior knowledge, and vocabulary ability, in comprehension were also examined. Using structural equation modeling, a latent executive function factor significantly predicted comprehension after accounting for age, reading time, prior knowledge, and vocabulary ability. Vocabulary ability mediated the relation between executive function and both lower-level and higher-level reading comprehension. Executive function contributed more strongly to lower-level compared with higher-level comprehension of the text. Implications for future research are discussed.},

  abstract = {There is little evidence showing the relationship between the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) and g (general intelligence). This research established the relationship between SAT and g, as well as the appropriateness of the SAT as a measure of g, and examined the SAT as a premorbid measure of intelligence. In Study 1, we used the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979. Measures of g were extracted from the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery and correlated with SAT scores of 917 participants. The resulting correlation was .82 (.86 corrected for nonlinearity). Study 2 investigated the correlation between revised and recentered SAT scores and scores on the Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices among 104 undergraduates. The resulting correlation was .483 (.72 corrected for restricted range). These studies indicate that the SAT is mainly a test of g. We provide equations for converting SAT scores to estimated IQs; such conversion could be useful for estimating premorbid IQ or conducting individual difference research with college students.},

Students were randomly assigned to control ( n = 213) and two variants of intervention ( n = 385) designed to improve arithmetic. Of each 30-minute intervention session (48 over 16 weeks), 25 minutes were identical in the two variants, focused on number knowledge that provides the conceptual bases for arithmetic. The other five minutes provided nonspeeded conceptual practice ( n = 196) or speeded strategic practice ( n = 199). Contrasts tested effects of intervention (combined across variants) versus control and effects between the variants. Moderation analysis indicated no significant interactions between at-risk children’s pre-intervention mathematics skill and either contrast on any outcome. Across pre-intervention math skill, effects favored intervention over control on arithmetic and transfer to double-digit calculations and number knowledge, and favored speeded over nonspeeded practice on arithmetic.},

Students were randomly assigned in equal numbers to the two tutoring conditions and a control group. Results indicated that students in the two tutored groups tended to perform comparably on all tests and to outperform controls (more so in grade 5 than grade 3) on near-transfer but not far-transfer measures of RC. This differential pattern of program effects for near- versus far-transfer measures raises questions about how tests of near-transfer and far-transfer are conventionally understood.},

Methods:                                Archival data were used from 250 heterogeneous neurosciences patients who were administered the WMS-IV as part of a standard neuropsychological assessment. Three theoretically motivated models for the latent structure of VerbalPA were tested using confirmatory factor analysis. The first model, based on cognitive principles of semantic processing from hub-and-spoke theory, tested whether performance is related to specific semantic features of target words. The second, motivated by the Cattell–Horn–Carroll (CHC) model of cognitive abilities, investigated whether the associative properties of items influence performance. A third, Hybrid model tested whether performance is related to both semantic and associative properties of items. The best-fitting model was tested for diagnostic group effects contrasting the heterogeneous neuroscience patients with subsets of left and right TLE (                 n                 = 51,                 n                 = 26, respectively) patients.                                                        Results:               The Hybrid model was found to have the best fit. Patients with left TLE scored significantly less well than the heterogeneous neurosciences sample on selected semantic factor scores, although the effect size was small.                                         Conclusions:               Future editions of the WMS may consider implementing a semantic scoring structure for the VerbalPA to facilitate test score interpretation. Additionally, these results suggest that principles of hub-and-spoke theory may be integrated into CHC cognitive ability taxonomy.},

Method:               This study used the D-KEFS standardization sample including 1,750 non-clinical participants. Several seven-factor models previously reported for the D-KEFS were re-evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Previously published bi-factor models were also tested. These models were compared with a three-factor a priori model based on Cattell–Horn–Carroll (CHC) theory. Measurement invariance was examined across three age cohorts.                                         Results:               All previously reported models failed to converge when tested with CFA. None of the bi-factor models converged after large numbers of iterations, suggesting that bi-factor models are ill-suited to represent the D-KEFS scores as reported in the test manual. Although poor fit was initially observed for the three-factor CHC model, inspection of modification indices showed potential for improvement by including method effects via correlated residuals for scores derived from similar tests. The final CHC model showed good to excellent fit and strong metric measurement invariance across the three age cohorts with minor exceptions for a subset of Fluency parameters.                                         Conclusions:               CHC theory extends to the D-KEFS, supporting findings from previous studies that executive functions can be integrated into CHC theory.},

By emphasizing concepts, logic, and practical applications over mathematical proofs, this book gives students an appreciation of how measurement problems can be addressed and why it is important to address them. Topics are presented accessibly using a wide variety of examples from behavioral science research so readers can see the importance of psychometric fundamentals in research. The fully-revised Fourth Edition now includes technical appendices in R software for relevant chapters, more than twice as many figures and tables to assist in the clarity of the presentation of information, and significant updates to the chapter text including edits for clarity, additional explanations of basic statistics and concepts, and new examples and references throughout"--},

It is intuitive to assume that low percentages (70\% or less) are "bad" and high percentages are "good". A positive predictive value of 20\%, for example, was cited as proof that a test should not be used even though the positive likelihood ratio for that same test was 50. A likelihood ratio of 50 means that the post test odds of disease for a positive test result will be 50 times higher than the pretest odds of disease. Now, that is a large increase in the odds. Critics of laboratory medicine fail to recognize that sensitivity and specificity vary with the strength of the signal. Thus, a value well above the cutoff is far more likely to indicate disease than does a value just above the cutoff--even though both are reported as "positive". Tables of likelihood ratios for a wide range of specific test results, or for multiple test results, provide more information than a simple four-by-four predictive value table. Likelihood ratios are also more informative than predictive values or ROC curves. Finally, critics of laboratory medicine fail to take into account the information to be derived from a confirmatory test, a repeat test at a later time, and from other tests.},

  abstract = {Procrastination is a prevalent and universal problematic behavior, largely impairing individual's health, wealth and well-being. Substantial studies have confirmed that conscientiousness, one of the big five personality, showed markedly inverse relation with procrastination. However, it is hitherto unknown about the neural basis underlying the impact of conscientiousness on procrastination. To address this issue, we employed the voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) methods to explore the neural substrates of conscientiousness responsible for procrastination (N = 330). In line with previous findings, the behavioral results showed a strong negative correlation between conscientiousness and procrastination (r = −.75). The VBM analysis found that conscientiousness was positively correlated with gray matter (GM) volumes in the left dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), right orbital frontal cortex (OFC) and right putamen, but negatively correlated with that in the left insula. Moreover, the RSFC results revealed that both dlPFC-IPL (inferior parietal lobule) and dlPFC-PCC (posterior cingulate gyrus) functional connectivity were positively associated with conscientiousness, while the functional connectivity of parahippocampal gyrus (PHC)-putamen and insula-IPL were negatively associated with conscientiousness. More importantly, the structural equation modeling (SEM) integrating RSFC results were well fitted for the influence process of conscientiousness on procrastination by both self-control (i.e., dlPFC-IPL, dlPFC-PCC) and motivation pathways (i.e., PHC-putamen, insula-IPL). The current findings suggest that self-control and motivation could be the two neural pathways underlying the impact of conscientiousness on procrastination, which provides a new perspective to understand the relationship between conscientiousness and procrastination.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The psychometric properties of the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ) as well as its prospective relationships with symptoms of depression and anxiety were studied in an adult general population sample. The results showed that the CERQ had good factorial validity and high reliabilities, with Cronbach's αs ranging between .75 and .87. In addition, the cognitive emotion regulation strategies accounted for considerable amounts of variance in emotional problems and strong relationships were found between the cognitive strategies self-blame, rumination, catastrophizing and positive reappraisal (inversely) and symptoms of depression and anxiety, both at first measurement and at follow-up. The CERQ might therefore be considered a valuable and reliable tool in the study of individual risk and protective factors associated with emotional problems, while providing us with important targets for intervention.},

  abstract = {Background               Nearly 40\% of patients who experience smell loss during SARS-CoV-2 infection may develop qualitative olfactory dysfunction, most commonly parosmia. Our evidence-based review summarizes the evolving literature and offers recommendations for the clinician on the management of patients experiencing parosmia associated with COVID-19.                                         Methods               We performed a systematic search using independent queries in PubMed, Embase, Ovid, and Cochrane databases, then categorized articles according to themes that emerged regarding epidemiology, effect on quality of life, disease progression, prognosis, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of parosmia.                                         Results               We identified 123 unique references meeting eligibility and performed title and abstract review with 2 independent reviewers, with 74 articles undergoing full-text review. An inductive approach to thematic development provided 7 central themes regarding qualitative olfactory dysfunction following COVID-19.                                         Conclusions               While other respiratory viruses are known to cause qualitative olfactory disturbances, the incidence of parosmia following COVID-19 is notable, and correlates negatively with age. The presence of parosmia predicts persistent quantitative olfactory dysfunction. Onset can occur months after infection, and symptoms may persist for well over 7 months. Affected patients report increased anxiety and decreased quality of life. Structured olfactory training with essential oils is the preferred treatment, where parosmia predicts recovery of aspects of quantitative smell loss when undergoing training. There is limited evidence that nasal corticosteroids may accelerate recovery of olfactory function. Patients should be prepared for the possibility that symptoms may persist for years, and providers should guide them to resources for coping with their psychosocial burden.},

Concurrent validity of the 41 content scales in the SII was examined for differentiating 31 college majors in a national college sample of 1,403 women and 469 men. Using discriminant analyses, three sets of content scales were used to predict major field of study. These were six General Occupational Scales, five Personal Style Scales, and 30 BISs. Each set of scales showed substantial concurrent validity in differentiating college major for women and men. The most specific scales, the BISs, were the most predictive of major, with hit rates 6 times greater than chance. Results clearly supported the concurrent validity and counseling utility of the content scales of the SII.},

Correspondingly, scholars have written much to guide researchers in this undertaking. Yet, many new scales violate established best practices in survey design, suggesting the need for a new approach to designing surveys. This article presents 6 steps to facilitate the construction of questionnaire scales. Unlike previous processes, this one front loads input from other academics and potential respondents in the item-development and revision phase with the goal of achieving credibility across both populations. Specifically, the article describes how (a) a literature review and (b) focus group–interview data can be (c) synthesized into a comprehensive list to facilitate (d) the development of items. Next, survey designers can subject the items to (e) an expert review and (f) cognitive pretesting before executing a pilot test.},

  abstract = {Just as receptive emotional abilities, productive emotional abilities are essential for social communication. Although individual differences in receptive emotional abilities, such as perceiving and recognizing emotions, are well-investigated, individual differences in productive emotional abilities, such as the ability to express emotions in the face, are largely neglected. Consequently, little is known about how emotion expression abilities fit in a nomological network of related abilities and typical behavior. We developed a multitask battery for measuring the ability to pose emotional expressions scored with facial expression recognition software. With three multivariate studies (n1 = 237; n2 = 141; n3 = 123), we test competing measurement models of emotion posing and relate this construct with other socio-emotional traits and cognitive abilities. We replicate the measurement model that includes a general factor of emotion posing, a nested task-specific factor, and emotion-specific factors. The emotion-posing ability factor is moderately to strongly related to receptive socio-emotional abilities, weakly related to general cognitive abilities, and weakly related to extraversion. This is strong evidence that emotion posing is a cognitive interpersonal ability. This new understanding of abilities in emotion communication opens a gateway for studying individual differences in social interaction.},

Second, we then used the resulting models to predict multiple types of reading, a highly important developmental outcome, using other well-known predictors as covariates. Participants were 844 children enrolled in third through fifth grade in urban public elementary schools who received 16 measures of processing speed that varied in the above dimensions. A two-factor complexity model that differentiated between simple and complex processing speed was the preferred model and fit the data well. Both types of PS predicted reading fluency, and complex (but not simple) PS predicted single word reading and comprehension. Results offer insight to the structure of processing speed, its relation to closely related concepts (such as executive function), and provide nuance to the understanding of the way processing speed influences reading.},

  abstract = {Vocational interests predict major life outcomes such as job performance, college major choice, and life goals. It is therefore important to gain a better understanding of their development during the crucial years of late childhood and early adolescence, when trait-like interests are starting to develop. The present study investigated the development of vocational interests in a longitudinal sample, comprising N\,=\,3,876 participants—assessed at four time points from ages 11 to 14. Stability, state-trait variance components, mean-level development, and gender differences in mean-levels of Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, and Conventional (RIASEC) dimensions were examined. Stabilities were moderate for all dimensions, but Realistic, Investigative, Social, and Conventional interests became more stable over time. For Realistic, Artistic, Social, and Conventional interests, the trait variance increased over time. At age 14, all dimensions had substantial trait variance components. The mean-levels of Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, and Conventional interests decreased over the 3 years (–0.44\,{$<$}\, d\,{$<$}\,–0.24). Initial gender differences—with girls having higher Artistic and Social interests and boys having higher Realistic and Investigative interests—increased over time. By investigating the development of vocational interests in late childhood and early adolescence, we complement previous findings and provide first insights about state-trait proportions in early adolescence.},

Leveraging the unique structure of the Louisville Twin Study (longitudinal data collected continuously from 1957 to 1999 using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children [WISC], WISC–R, and WISC–III ed.), multilevel analyses revealed between‐subjects Flynn Effects—as both decrease in mean scores upon test re‐standardization and increase in mean scores across cohorts—as well as within‐child Flynn Effects on cognitive growth across age. Overall gains equaled approximately three IQ points per decade. Novel genetically informed analyses suggested that individual sensitivity to the Flynn Effect was moderated by an interplay of genetic and environmental factors.},

The present study explored whether a non‐meditative practice could be successfully applied in a forensic application; specifically, whether mindfulness instructions can be embedded in the face‐composite construction process to facilitate identification. Twenty participants, who were not football fans, were asked to memorise an unfamiliar footballer's face and return 24\,hr later to construct a face using the self‐administered EvoFIT facial composite system. In the experimental condition, mindfulness instructions were embedded in the EvoFIT system, encouraging witnesses to focus on the target face and the process; in the control condition, participants constructed the face using the standard EvoFIT system. Naming of the composites was attempted by 24 football fans, who each viewed 10 composites, five from each condition, and then the target footballer images to ensure they were familiar with the identities. Results showed significantly higher levels of correct naming for composites constructed using EvoFIT with mindfulness instructions compared to using the standard EvoFIT. These findings indicate the potential for non‐meditative mindfulness instructions to assist face‐composite construction, improving correct naming of ensuing composites.},

  abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and the broader autistic phenotype (BAP) have been suggested to be associated with perceptual–cognitive difficulties processing human faces. However, the empirical results are mixed, arguably, in part due to inadequate samples and analyses. Consequently, we administered the Cambridge Face Perception Test (CFPT), the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), a vocabulary test, and the Autism Quotient (AQ) to a sample of 318 adults in the general community. Based on a disattenuated path analytic modelling strategy, we found that both face perception ability (β\,=\,–.21) and facial emotional expression recognition ability (β\,=\,–.27) predicted uniquely and significantly the Communication dimension of AQ. Vocabulary failed to yield a significant, direct effect onto the Communication dimension of the AQ. We conclude that difficulties perceiving information from the faces of others may contribute to difficulties in nonverbal communication, as conceptualised and measured within the context of BAP.},

  abstract = {Relatively narcissistic people are attracted to cryptocurrencies, though it is unclear whether they are differentially attracted to cryptocurrencies over other investments. Furthermore, theoretically, only narcissistic admiration, rather than narcissistic rivalry, would be expected to associate with attitudes toward cryptocurrencies. Intelligence and financial literacy are also proposed individual difference predictors of attitudes toward investments. Consequently, we administered measures of narcissistic admiration and rivalry, a financial literacy test, and a battery of intelligence tests to a sample of young adults (N = 372). Based on a structural equation model, narcissistic admiration and narcissistic rivalry differentially predicted attitudes toward cryptocurrencies (admiration, positively; rivalry, negatively), but both failed to associate significantly with attitudes toward stocks. Furthermore, financial literacy was a unique, positive predictor of attitudes toward stocks, whereas intelligence was a unique, negative predictor of attitudes toward cryptocurrencies. Our findings support the notion that narcissism is differentially associated with attitudes toward cryptocurrencies, though only narcissistic admiration (positively), consistent with the hypersensitivities to reward theory. Finally, higher levels of intelligence, controlling for financial literacy and narcissism, associated negatively with attitudes toward cryptocurrencies, perhaps due to the influence of scepticism.},

  abstract = {Objective: Naturalistic and neurophysiological assessments are relevant as outcome measures in autism intervention trials because they provide, respectively, ecologically valid information about functioning and underlying neurocognitive mechanisms. We conducted a systematic review to highlight which specific neurophysiological techniques, experimental tasks, and naturalistic protocols have been used to assess neural and behavioral functioning in autism intervention studies. Methods: Studies were collected from four electronic databases between October 2019 and February 2020: MEDLINE (via PubMed), PsycINFO, LILACS, and Web of Science, and were included if they used structured observational, naturalistic, or neurophysiological measures to assess the efficacy of a nonpharmacological intervention for ASD. Results: Fourteen different measures were used by 64 studies, with the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule the most frequently used instrument. Thirty-seven different coding systems of naturalistic measures were used across 51 studies, most of which used different protocols. Twenty-four neurophysiological measures were used in 16 studies, with different experimental paradigms and neurophysiological components used across studies. Conclusions: Cross-study variability in assessing the outcomes of autism interventions may obscure comparisons and conclusions about how different behavioral interventions affect autistic social communication and underlying neurophysiological mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Declarative fact knowledge is a key component of crystallized intelligence. It is typically measured with multiple-choice (MC) items. Other response formats, such as open-ended formats are less frequently used, although these formats might be superior for measuring crystallized intelligence. Whereas MC formats presumably only require recognizing the correct response to a question, open-ended formats supposedly require cognitive processes such as searching for, retrieving, and actively deciding on a response from long-term memory. If the methods of inquiry alter the cognitive processes involved, mean-changes between methods for assessing declarative knowledge should come along with changes in the covariance structure. We tested these assumptions in two online studies administering declarative knowledge items in different response formats (MC, open-ended, and open-ended with cues). Item difficulty clearly increases in the open-ended methods although effects in logistic regression models vary slightly across items. Importantly, latent variable analyses suggest that the method of inquiry does not affect what is measured with different response formats. These findings clearly endorse the position that crystallized intelligence does not change as a function of the response format.},

It is the HOPE Lab’s 3rd national survey; the other two focused on community colleges. This year we report on 43,000 students at 66 institutions in 20 states and the District of Columbia. That includes over 20,000 students at 35 4-year colleges and universities, as well as students at community colleges. We find: • 36\% of university students were food insecure in the 30 days preceding the survey. This year’s estimate for community college students is 42\%, but our larger study last year found 56\%.2 • 36\% of university students were housing insecure in the last year. Housing insecurity affected 51\% of community college students in last year’s study, and 46\% in this year’s study. • 9\% of university students were homeless in the last year. In comparison, 12\% of community college students were homeless in this year’s survey, and 14\% in last year’s survey. The data show that basic needs insecurities disproportionately affect marginalized students and are associated with long work hours and higher risk of unemployment. However, the level of academic effort – in and outside the classroom—is the same regardless of whether or not students are dealing with food and housing insecurity. It is therefore critically important to match their commitments with supports to ensure degree completion.},

  abstract = {The neuromodulator acetylcholine modulates spatial integration in visual cortex by altering the balance of inputs that generate neuronal receptive fields. These cholinergic effects may provide a neurobiological mechanism underlying the modulation of visual representations by visual spatial attention. However, the consequences of cholinergic enhancement on visuospatial perception in humans are unknown. We conducted two experiments to test whether enhancing cholinergic signaling selectively alters perceptual measures of visuospatial interactions in human subjects. In Experiment 1, a double-blind placebo-controlled pharmacology study, we measured how flanking distractors influenced detection of a small contrast decrement of a peripheral target, as a function of target-flanker distance. We found that cholinergic enhancement with the cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil improved target detection, and modeling suggested that this was mainly due to a narrowing of the extent of facilitatory perceptual spatial interactions. In Experiment 2, we tested whether these effects were selective to the cholinergic system or would also be observed following enhancements of related neuromodulators dopamine or norepinephrine. Unlike cholinergic enhancement, dopamine (bromocriptine) and norepinephrine (guanfacine) manipulations did not improve performance or systematically alter the spatial profile of perceptual interactions between targets and distractors. These findings reveal mechanisms by which cholinergic signaling influences visual spatial interactions in perception and improves processing of a visual target among distractors, effects that are notably similar to those of spatial selective attention.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Acetylcholine influences how visual cortical neurons integrate signals across space, perhaps providing a neurobiological mechanism for the effects of visual selective attention. However, the influence of cholinergic enhancement on visuospatial perception remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that cholinergic enhancement improves detection of a target flanked by distractors, consistent with sharpened visuospatial perceptual representations. Furthermore, whereas most pharmacological studies focus on a single neurotransmitter, many neuromodulators can have related effects on cognition and perception. Thus, we also demonstrate that enhancing noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems does not systematically improve visuospatial perception or alter its tuning. Our results link visuospatial tuning effects of acetylcholine at the neuronal and perceptual levels and provide insights into the connection between cholinergic signaling and visual attention.}

This would have many practical implications, including possible increases in academic achievement. The current brief review of behavioral approaches to cognitive enhancement focuses on the cognitive abilities most predictive of academic success: fluid intelligence, working memory, executive functions, spatial thinking, and visual attention. Researchers are currently testing a range of possible approaches to enhancing these cognitive skills. These include everything from having people repeatedly practice the same types of psychology tests that are used to measure the cognitive abilities, to developing custom cognitive training platforms, to the use of commercial entertainment video games. Existing data warrant guarded optimism, but more research is needed to justify widespread adoption. Policymakers can help (e.g., by promoting best-practice science), and researchers need to consider ethical issues as the field progresses.},

The first approach is based on meta-analysis and incremental validity analysis research and the main assumption is that general mental ability (GMA) is the best job performance predictor regardless of the occupation. The second approach, referred to as specific validity theory, assumes that job-unique weighting of different specific mental abilities (SMA) is a better predictor of job performance than GMA and occupational context cannot be ignored when job performance is predicted. The validity study of both GMA and SMA as predictors of job performance across different occupational groups (N = 4033, k = 15) was conducted. The results were analyzed by calculating observed validity coefficients and with the use of the incremental validity and the relative importance analysis. The results supports the specific validity theory – SMA proved to be a valid job performance predictor and occupational context moderated GMA validity.}

  abstract = {Robust evidence supports the efficacy of early autism intervention. Despite broad consensus that earlier intervention leads to better outcomes, evidence for this has been limited to correlational studies. This study examined timing effects of the Early Social Interaction (ESI) model, a parent-implemented intervention, using a complete crossover randomized controlled trial (RCT). Effects of Individual-ESI were compared when initiated at 18 or 27\,months of age, and also contrasted with effects of the less intensive Group-ESI as an active control condition. Participants included 82 autistic toddlers who received 9\,months of Individual-ESI and 9\,months of Group-ESI, with the timing/order randomized. Blinded clinicians completed assessments at baseline (18\,months of age), end of Condition 1 (27\,months), and end of Condition 2 (36\,months). Toddlers randomized to Individual-ESI at 18\,months showed greater gains during treatment than those starting Individual-ESI at 27\,months in receptive/expressive language, social communication, and daily living skills. This pattern was not observed for Group-ESI, demonstrating that timing effects were specific to Individual-ESI and ruling out maturation effects. This RCT demonstrated that earlier intensive, individualized intervention led to greater improvements, and suggests that even a narrow window of 18 versus 27\,months may impact child outcomes.                            Lay abstract               Behavioral interventions that incorporate naturalistic, developmental strategies have been shown to improve outcomes for young children who receive an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis. Although there is broad consensus that children on the spectrum should begin supports as soon as possible, the empirical evidence for this is relatively limited and little is known about the optimal age to start autism-specific interventions. Our team conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the effects of starting intervention at different ages, using the Early Social Interaction (ESI) model, a parent-implemented intervention for toddlers on the spectrum. Participants included 82 autistic toddlers and their caregiver(s) who received 9 months of Individual-ESI and 9 months of Group-ESI, with the timing/order of these two treatment conditions randomized. Thus, families received the more intensive and individualized Individual-ESI at either 18 or 27\,months of age. Results revealed that children who received Individual-ESI earlier showed greater treatment gains than those who received this intervention later. Gains were demonstrated in several areas, which included the use and understanding of language, social use of communication skills, and self-help skills. Importantly, these findings were specific to the intensive and individualized parent coaching model compared to group-based treatment, allowing us to rule out the possibility that these timing effects were due to children getting older rather than the treatment itself. Our results suggest that even a narrow window of 18 versus 27\,months may have an impact on outcomes and underscore the importance of screening and evaluation as young as possible.},

  abstract = {In their response to our article (both in this issue), DeYoung and colleagues did not sufficiently address three fundamental flaws with the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP). First, HiTOP was created using a simple-structure factor-analytic approach, which does not adequately represent the dimensional space of the symptoms of psychopathology. Consequently, HiTOP is not the empirical structure of psychopathology. Second, factor analysis and dimensional ratings do not fix the problems inherent to descriptive (folk) classification; self-reported symptoms are still the basis on which clinical judgments about people are made. Finally, HiTOP is not ready to use in real-world clinical settings. There is currently no empirical evidence demonstrating that clinicians who use HiTOP have better clinical outcomes than those who use the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM). In sum, HiTOP is a factor-analytic variation of the DSM that does not get the field closer to a more valid and useful taxonomy.},

BMI, systolic blood pressure, coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes showed negative associations with cognitive ability; height was positively associated with cognitive ability. The analyses provided no evidence for casual associations from health to cognitive ability. In the other direction, higher educational attainment predicted lower BMI, systolic blood pressure, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, and taller stature. The analyses indicated no causal association from educational attainment to physical health. The lack of evidence for causal associations between cognitive ability, educational attainment, and physical health could be explained by weak instrumental variables, poorly measured outcomes, or the small number of disease cases.},

In particular, moral diversity is identified as being problematic and even self‐contradictory. Three studies of attitudes and desires for interaction among college students confirmed that moral diversity reduces desires for interaction more than does demographic diversity, and that both kinds of diversity are valued more in a classroom than in other social settings. These findings have important implications for discussions of diversity, multiculturalism, affirmative action, identity politics, and immigration policy.},

  abstract = {Cognitive–achievement relations research has been instrumental in understanding the development of academic skills and learning difficulties. Most cognitive–achievement relations research has been conducted with large samples and represent average relations across the ability spectrum. A notable gap in the literature is whether these relations vary by cognitive ability levels (IQ). This study examined cognitive–achievement relations across different general ability levels (Low, Average, and High) to fill this gap. Based on Spearman’s Law of Diminishing Returns, it would be expected that general intelligence would be a stronger predictor of academic skills at lower levels of IQ, and more specific abilities would be stronger predictors of academic skills at higher levels of IQ. To test this, multi-group path analysis and structural equation modeling were used to examine whether integrated models of cognitive–reading relations are differentiated by IQ levels in the Woodcock–Johnson III and Woodcock–Johnson IV standardization samples. Global and broad cognitive abilities were used as predictors of basic reading skills and reading comprehension for elementary and secondary school students. The magnitude of prediction differed across ability groups in some cases, but not all. Importantly, the variance explained in basic reading skills and reading comprehension tended to be larger for the Low group compared to the Average and High groups. When variance accounted for by general intelligence was removed from the broad abilities, the effects of the broad abilities were similar across ability groups, but the indirect effects of g were higher for the Low group. Additionally, g had stronger relative effects on reading in the Low group, and broad abilities had stronger relative effects on reading in the Average and High groups. The implications and limitations of this study are discussed.},

  abstract = {Cognitive ability tests are often included in diagnostic psychological assessments in school settings for the evaluation of specific learning disabilities (Benson et al., 2019). This session will involve a discussion of recent developments of the theory and practice of cognitive assessment, and the interpretative flexibility afforded by different instruments. We demonstrate the value-added benefit of using cognitive assessment judiciously to make valid decisions to inform placement and treatment. Learning Objectives: 1. Participants will understand recent developments in CHC theory and how it applies to assessment and interpretation 2. Participants will learn about the interpretative flexibility afforded by the three most popular IQ tests (WISC-V, KABCII NU, WJ IV) 3. Participants will examine how cognitive assessment results can clarify identification and treatment outcomes using a case example},

To that end, we examined data from 192 college undergraduates who completed both the MMPI-3 and MMPI-2-RF-EX 1 week apart using a counterbalanced design. Across versions, mean T-scores and standard deviations, estimates of internal consistency, and standard error of measurement values, were highly similar, indicating no clinically meaningful differences across versions. We also compared between-version test–retest comparability values with within-version values calculated using a sample of undergraduates ( N = 318) who completed the MMPI-2-RF-EX twice over the same time interval, finding only marginal differences across the two samples. Finally, we computed column-vector correlations between MMPI-3 scores from both versions and several criterion measures, where results reflected no effect of test version on external validity. Overall, we determined that scale scores derived from either booklet are psychometrically interchangeable, indicating that MMPI-3 scale scores obtained from an administration of the MMPI-2-RF-EX can be applied when using the 335-item MMPI-3.},

  abstract = {Scores on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) predict military job (and training) performance better than any single variable so far identified. However, it remains unclear what factors explain this predictive relationship. Here, we investigated the contributions of fluid intelligence (Gf) and two executive functions—placekeeping ability and attention control—to the relationship between the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) score from the ASVAB and job-relevant multitasking performance. Psychometric network analyses revealed that Gf and placekeeping ability independently contributed to and largely explained the AFQT–multitasking performance relationship. The contribution of attention control to this relationship was negligible. However, attention control did relate positively and significantly to Gf and placekeeping ability, consistent with the hypothesis that it is a cognitive “primitive” underlying the individual differences in higher-level cognition. Finally, hierarchical regression analyses revealed stronger evidence for the incremental validity of Gf and placekeeping ability in the prediction of multitasking performance than for the incremental validity of attention control. The results shed light on factors that may underlie the predictive validity of global measures of cognitive ability and suggest how the ASVAB might be augmented to improve its predictive validity.},

When determining the curriculum and interventions used to teach, a collaborative team of caretakers and educators should consider use of current state and national standards when determining the scope and sequence in order to promote a healthy knowledge of sexuality while ensuring use of effective models with use of evidence-based interventions to teach sexuality education. In some cases, inappropriate sexual behaviors must be addressed through use of behavior analytic assessments in order to effectively address problem behavior while teaching healthy and appropriate sexual behavior. Additionally, it will be important for the collaborative team to address any risks and ramifications of not fully addressing sexuality education with individuals with IDD. Part of that process will be to ensure all caretakers responsible for teaching the curriculum are fully trained and familiar with all components of the curriculum as well as addressing any cultural norms or areas of discomfort that might hinder effective implementation of the teaching.},

Some investigators assert that the PCL-R, ostensibly based on Cleckley's work, has “drifted” from the construct described in his Clinical Profile. We evaluate this profile, note its basis in an unrepresentative sample of patients, and suggest that its literal and uncritical acceptance by the research community has become problematical. We also argue that the idea of construct “drift” is irrelevant to current conceptualizations of psychopathy, which are better informed by the extensive empirical research on the integration of structural, genetic, developmental, personality, and neurobiological research findings than by rigid adherence to early clinical formulations. We offer some suggestions for future research on psychopathy.},

  abstract = {We propose a compensatory interactive influence of conscientiousness and GMA in task performance such that conscientiousness is most beneficial to performance for low-GMA individuals. Drawing on trait by trait interaction theory and empirical evidence for a compensatory mechanism of conscientiousness for low GMA, we contrast our hypothesis with prior research on a conscientiousness-GMA interaction and argue that prior research considered a different interaction type. We argue that observing a compensatory interaction likely requires (a) considering the appropriate interaction form, including a possible curvilinear conscientiousness-performance relationship; (b) measuring the full conscientiousness domain (as opposed to motivation proxies); (c) narrowing the criterion domain to reflect task performance; and (d) appropriate psychometric scoring of variables to increase power and avoid type 1 error. In four employee samples (N1\,=\,300; N2\,=\,261; N3\,=\,1,413; N4\,=\,948), we test a conscientiousness-GMA interaction in two employee samples. In three of four samples, results support a nuanced compensatory mechanism such that conscientiousness compensates for low to moderate GMA, and high conscientiousness may be detrimental to or unimportant for task performance in high-GMA individuals.},

  abstract = {Background               The role of gender in both spatial and mathematics performance has been extensively studied separately, with a male advantage often found in spatial tasks and mathematics from adolescence. Spatial reasoning is consistently linked to mathematics proficiency, yet despite this, little research has investigated the role of spatial orientation and gender in the relationship between spatial reasoning and mathematics.                                         Aims               In the present study, three spatial reasoning constructs (mental rotation, spatial visualization, and spatial orientation) were examined for their unique contributions to mathematics performance in two samples (Study 1: grade 5; Study 2: grade 8). In light of the emerging gender gap in mathematics as children develop, these relationships were explored as a function of gender.                                         Sample               Eighty‐four fifth‐grade students participated in Study 1 (43 females, 41 males; mean age~=~11.19~years). Nine hundred and three eighth‐grade students participated in Study 2 (498 females, 405 males; mean age~=~13.83~years).                                         Methods               The three spatial reasoning constructs (mental rotation, spatial visualization, and spatial orientation) were examined for their unique contributions to mathematics performance for females and males in general and across different mathematical content (geometry–measurement and number sense).                                         Results               Spatial factors accounted for 51\% of the variance in math scores in Study 1 (grade 5) and 32\% of the variance in math scores in Study 2 (grade 8). In both studies, spatial factors predicted a larger proportion of variance in geometry–measurement than for number sense. Spatial orientation was found to be a unique contributor in all mathematics models, object‐based spatial skills (mental rotation and spatial visualization) varied in their contribution to math performance depending on mathematics content and gender.                                         Conclusions               The present work highlights the unique contribution of spatial orientation in the spatial–mathematics relationship and provides insights into the nature of gender differences in mathematical problem‐solving as a function of spatial reasoning and mathematics content.},

Regression analyses demonstrated that the General Occupational Themes (GOTs) and Personal Style Scales (PSSs) each explained significant and independent variance in SWB. Occupation-specific hypotheses for GOTs and PSSs were also supported for four of the eight occupations. This study enhances the understanding of the contribution of interests to life satisfaction and provides further validation for the 2005 SII, specifically the newest PSS, Team Orientation.

We have conducted a comprehensive review of published taxometric research that included 177 articles, 311 distinct findings and a combined sample of 533 377 participants. Multilevel logistic regression analyses have examined the methodological and substantive variables associated with taxonic (categorical) findings. Although 38.9\% of findings were taxonic, these findings were much less frequent in more recent and methodologically stronger studies, and in those reporting comparative fit indices based on simulated comparison data. When these and other possible confounds were statistically controlled, the true prevalence of taxonic findings was estimated at 14\%. The domains of normal personality, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, externalizing disorders, and personality disorders (PDs) other than schizotypal yielded little persuasive evidence of taxa. Promising but still not definitive evidence of psychological taxa was confined to the domains of schizotypy, substance use disorders and autism. This review indicates that most latent variables of interest to psychiatrists and personality and clinical psychologists are dimensional, and that many influential taxonic findings of early taxometric research are likely to be spurious.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Taxometric procedures have been used extensively to investigate whether individual differences in personality and psychopathology are latently dimensional or categorical (‘taxonic’). We report the first meta-analysis of taxometric research, examining 317 findings drawn from 183 articles that employed an index of the comparative fit of observed data to dimensional and taxonic data simulations. Findings supporting dimensional models outnumbered those supporting taxonic models five to one. There were systematic differences among 17 construct domains in support for the two models, but psychopathology was no more likely to generate taxonic findings than normal variation (i.e. individual differences in personality, response styles, gender, and sexuality). No content domain showed aggregate support for the taxonic model. Six variables – alcohol use disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, problem gambling, autism, suicide risk, and pedophilia – emerged as the most plausible taxon candidates based on a preponderance of independently replicated findings. We also compared the 317 meta-analyzed findings to 185 additional taxometric findings from 96 articles that did not employ the comparative fit index. Studies that used the index were 4.88 times more likely to generate dimensional findings than those that did not after controlling for construct domain, implying that many taxonic findings obtained before the popularization of simulation-based techniques are spurious. The meta-analytic findings support the conclusion that the great majority of psychological differences between people are latently continuous, and that psychopathology is no exception.},

  abstract = {Symmetrical bifactor models are frequently applied to diverse symptoms of psychopathology to identify a general P factor. This factor is assumed to mark shared liability across all psychopathology dimensions and mental disorders. Despite their popularity, however, symmetrical bifactor models of P often yield anomalous results, including but not limited to nonsignificant or negative specific factor variances and nonsignificant or negative factor loadings. To date, these anomalies have often been treated as nuisances to be explained away. In this article, we demonstrate why these anomalies alter the substantive meaning of P such that it (a) does not reflect general liability to psychopathology and (b) differs in meaning across studies. We then describe an alternative modeling framework, the bifactor-( S−1) approach. This method avoids anomalous results, provides a framework for explaining unexpected findings in published symmetrical bifactor studies, and yields a well-defined general factor that can be compared across studies when researchers hypothesize what construct they consider “transdiagnostically meaningful” and measure it directly. We present an empirical example to illustrate these points and provide concrete recommendations to help researchers decide for or against specific variants of bifactor structure.},

  abstract = {Visual working memory (VWM) is typically measured using arrays of two-dimensional isolated stimuli with simple visual identities (e.g., color or shape), and these studies typically find strong capacity limits. Science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) experts are tasked with reasoning with representations of three-dimensional (3D) connected objects, raising questions about whether those stimuli would be subject to the same limits. Here, we use a color change detection task to examine working memory capacity for 3D objects made up of differently colored cubes. Experiment 1a shows that increasing the number of parts of an object leads to less sensitivity to color changes, while change-irrelevant structural dimensionality (the number of dimensions into which parts of the structure extend) does not. Experiment 1b shows that sensitivity to color changes decreases similarly with increased complexity for multipart 3D connected objects and disconnected 2D squares, while sensitivity is slightly higher with 3D objects. Experiments 2a and 2b find that when other stimulus characteristics, such as size and visual angle, are controlled, change-irrelevant dimensionality and connectivity have no effect on performance. These results suggest that detecting color changes on 3D connected objects and on displays of isolated 2D stimuli are subject to similar set size effects and are not affected by dimensionality and connectivity when these properties are change-irrelevant, ruling out one possible explanation for scientists’ advantages in storing and manipulating representations of complex 3D objects.},

  abstract = {In the US, undeniable evidence shows that socioeconomic inequities explain a high proportion of individual differences in school achievement. Although not all countries show this same effect due to socioeconomic status, it is consistently found that social inequities lead to achievement gaps. These achievement gaps then manifest into trajectories that set some individuals on a path of lower incomes, poorer health and higher mortality, lower wellbeing, and other poor adult outcomes. Like James Flynn so handily reminded the scientific literature that achievement gaps are explainable by environmental factors, the inequities we see around the world are based on environments some children are exposed to. In his work, Flynn stated his belief that the suppression of scientific work on intelligence would continue to lead to social inequities. We wish to take this idea and move it forward. We believe that the scientific construct of intelligence plays a key role in helping create a more equitable society through science. We also believe that the poor perception of intelligence, rooted in historical realities, means that it will continue to be misunderstood, feared, and misused, limiting how effective it could be in helping to close gaps in achievement and in creating a more equitable society.},

Next, we define a modern, non-g, emergent view of intelligence using the process overlap theory and argue for its use in improving equitable practices. We then review the empirical evidence, focusing on sub-measures of g to highlight the utility of non-g, emergent models in promoting equity and fairness.

As part of that plan, states and school districts that receive Title I funds must participate in NAEP assessments in reading and math at grades 4 and 8 every two years. The purpose of NAEP has always been to survey what students know and can do and to monitor changes over time. Now, NAEP has a new role, to act as a serious discussion tool in evaluating results of state assessments and in providing a common base for comparison between states. This role brings new challenges and opportunities for the NAEP program.}

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               The Treatable ID~App was created in 2012~as digital tool to improve early recognition and intervention for treatable inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs) presenting with global developmental delay and intellectual disability (collectively ‘treatable IDs’). Our aim is to update the 2012 review on treatable IDs and App to capture the advances made in the identification of new IMDs along with increased pathophysiological insights catalyzing therapeutic development and implementation.                                         Methods               Two independent reviewers queried PubMed, OMIM and Orphanet databases to reassess all previously included disorders and therapies and to identify all reports on Treatable IDs published between 2012 and 2021. These were included if listed in the International Classification of IMDs (ICIMD) and presenting with~ID as a major feature, and if published evidence for a therapeutic intervention improving ID primary and/or secondary outcomes is~available. Data on clinical symptoms,~diagnostic testing, treatment strategies, effects on outcomes, and evidence levels were extracted and evaluated by the reviewers and external experts. The generated knowledge was translated into a diagnostic algorithm and updated version of the App with novel features.                                         Results               Our review identified 116 treatable IDs (139 genes), of which 44 newly identified, belonging to 17 ICIMD categories. The most frequent therapeutic interventions were nutritional, pharmacological and vitamin and trace element supplementation. Evidence level varied from 1 to 3 (trials, cohort studies, case–control studies) for 19\% and 4–5 (case-report, expert opinion) for 81\% of treatments. Reported effects included improvement of clinical deterioration in 62\%, neurological manifestations in 47\% and development in 37\%.                                         Conclusion               The number of treatable IDs identified by our literature review increased by more than one-third in eight years. Although there has been much attention to gene-based and enzyme replacement therapy, the majority of effective treatments are nutritional, which are relatively affordable, widely available and (often) surprisingly effective. We present a diagnostic algorithm (adjustable to local resources and expertise) and the~updated App to facilitate a swift and accurate workup, prioritizing treatable IDs. Our digital tool is freely available as Native and Web App~(www.treatable-id.org) with several novel features. Our Treatable ID endeavor contributes to the Treatabolome and International Rare Diseases Research Consortium goals, enabling clinicians to deliver rapid evidence-based interventions to our rare disease patients.},

Subtest profile analysis from traditional cognitive assessment has drawn sharp criticism for inaccurate identification and weak connections to educational planning. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to use a new generation of cognitive tests with megacluster analysis to augment diagnosis and the instructional process.The Cognitive Assessment System uses a contemporary theoretical model in which composite scores, instead of subtest scores, are used for profile analysis. Ten core profiles from a regular education sample ( N = 1,692) and 12 profiles from a sample of students with LD ( N = 367) were found. The majority of the LD profiles were unique compared with profiles obtained from the general education sample. The implications of this study substantiate the usefulness of profile analysis on composite scores as a critical element in LD determination.},

In doing this, we explain the elements needed for fluent reading and how they relate to each other in a multilayered fashion in young readers, and discuss the implications of this model in the development and assessment of reading fluency.},

  abstract = {Modern society is driven by the use of cognitive artifacts: physical instruments or styles of reasoning that amplify our ability to think. The artifacts range from writing systems to computers. In everyday life, a person demonstrates intelligence by showing skill in using these artifacts. Intelligence tests and their surrogates force examinees to exhibit some of these skills but not others. This is why test scores correlate substantially but not perfectly with a variety of measures of socioeconomic success. The same thing is true at the international level. Nations can be evaluated by the extent to which their citizens score well on cognitive tests, including both avowed intelligence tests and a variety of tests of academic achievement. The resulting scores are substantially correlated with various indices of national wealth, health, environmental quality, and schooling and with a vaguer variable, social commitment to innovation. These environmental variables are suggested as causes of the differences in general cognitive skills between national populations. It is conceivable that differences in gene pools also contribute to international and, within nations, group differences in cognitive skills, but at present it is impossible to evaluate the extent of genetic influences.},

  abstract = {We describe three studies that together provide a first approximation to a comprehensive taxonomy of unique personality facets. In Study 1, we semantically sorted, removed synonyms, and factor analysed 1772 personality items taken from seven major omnibus personality inventories and four narrow inventories. Study 1 identified 61 base facets. In Study 2, we conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify facets missing from the 61 base facets. We identified 16 novel facets. We then created standardised, open access items for the 77 facets. In Study 3, we administered the items to a novel sample ( N = 1096) and assessed the psychometric properties of the facets. The ultimate result was 70 personality facet scales that are open access, psychometrically robust, unidimensional, and discriminant. We call this inventory the Facet-level Multidimensional Assessment of Personality or Facet MAP, version 1. The Facet MAP contains scales equivalent to almost all scales present in major personality inventories, and in most cases, many more as well. As the Facet MAP develops, we hope it will eventually provide a comprehensive taxonomy of personality facets, which will prove useful in reducing construct proliferation and facilitating numerous avenues of important personality research. The Facet MAP items and user manual can be found at: facetmap.org.},

  abstract = {Psychological autopsy is one of the most valuable tools of research on completed suicide. The method involves collecting all available information on the deceased via structured interviews of family members, relatives or friends as well as attending health care personnel. In addition, information is collected from available health care and psychiatric records, other documents, and forensic examination. Thus a psychological autopsy synthesizes the information from multiple informants and records. The early generation of psychological autopsies established that more than 90\% of completed suicides have suffered from usually co-morbid mental disorders, most of them mood disorders and/or substance use disorders. Furthermore, they revealed the remarkable undertreatment of these mental disorders, often despite contact with psychiatric or other health care services. More recent psychological autopsy studies have mostly used case-control designs, thus having been better able to estimate the role of various risk factors for suicide. The future psychological autopsy studies may be more focused on interactions between risk factors or risk factor domains, focused on some specific suicide populations of major interest for suicide prevention, or combined psychological autopsy methodology with biological measurements.},

  abstract = {Does cognitive training work? There are numerous commercial training interventions claiming to improve general mental capacity; however, the scientific evidence for such claims is sparse. Nevertheless, there is accumulating evidence that certain cognitive interventions are effective. Here we provide evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive (often called “brain”) training. However, we demonstrate that there are important individual differences that determine training and transfer. We trained elementary and middle school children by means of a videogame-like working memory task. We found that only children who considerably improved on the training task showed a performance increase on untrained fluid intelligence tasks. This improvement was larger than the improvement of a control group who trained on a knowledge-based task that did not engage working memory; further, this differential pattern remained intact even after a 3-mo hiatus from training. We conclude that cognitive training can be effective and long-lasting, but that there are limiting factors that must be considered to evaluate the effects of this training, one of which is individual differences in training performance. We propose that future research should not investigate whether cognitive training works, but rather should determine what training regimens and what training conditions result in the best transfer effects, investigate the underlying neural and cognitive mechanisms, and finally, investigate for whom cognitive training is most useful.},

Seventy-three children (ages 7–17) categorized as poor decoders, poor comprehenders, or average readers were administered a battery of achievement and cognitive measures for three consecutive years. Hierarchical linear modeling showed that growth in executive processing (inhibition) in children with RD constrained growth in reading and math.

  abstract = {We review research aimed at the development of a compelling taxonomy of personality‐descriptive terms. We identify five issues central to the construction of personality taxonomies and discuss the advantages and limitations of the lexical approach. Our review of research stimulated by this approach begins with Allport and Odbert's trait names, retraces the procedures that led to Cattell's personality factors, and summarizes contemporary work in English and in Dutch. Taxonomers and lay people alike view stable traits as the most fundamental personality concepts. At the broadest level of abstraction, this domain is often represented by five dimensions related to Power (or Surgency), Love (Agreeableness), Work (Conscientiousness), Affect (Emotional Stability), and Intellect (Culture). However, given that their number and interpretation are still debated, these dimensions should not be considered final but as a heuristically useful framework. Indeed, if the fifth dimension represents Intellect, our review suggests that Culture, Values and even Autonomy‐Conformity might be additional dimensions. Some researchers, such as Goldberg and Wiggins, have constructed more narrow categories to permit a differentiated mapping of trait descriptors. Taxonomies of states, activities, and social roles and effects still need to be developed; a broad conception of personality might also include health, fitness, and physical attractiveness. A comprehensive taxonomy would provide a common framework for research guided by different theoretical orientations and could guide the selection of variables for research. Ultimately, the value of a taxonomy depends on its success in predicting important outcomes in people's lives.},

A meta-analysis of 32 studies was conducted to examine the cognitive processing differences between students with SLD and typically achieving peers. The analysis found moderately large to large effect sizes in cognitive processing differences between groups of students with SLD and typically achieving students. These differences are of sufficient magnitude to justify including measures of cognitive processing ability in the evaluation and identification of SLD.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Objective:               The Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) describes an assessment battery and a family of population-representative studies measuring neuropsychological performance. We describe the factorial structure of the HCAP battery in the US Health and Retirement Study (HRS).                                         Method:               The HCAP battery was compiled from existing measures by a cross-disciplinary and international panel of researchers. The HCAP battery was used in the 2016 wave of the HRS. We used factor analysis methods to assess and refine a theoretically driven single and multiple domain factor structure for tests included in the HCAP battery among 3,347 participants with evaluable performance data.                                         Results:               For the eight domains of cognitive functioning identified (orientation, memory [immediate, delayed, and recognition], set shifting, attention/speed, language/fluency, and visuospatial), all single factor models fit reasonably well, although four of these domains had either 2 or 3 indicators where fit must be perfect and is not informative. Multidimensional models suggested the eight-domain model was overly complex. A five-domain model (orientation, memory delayed and recognition, executive functioning, language/fluency, visuospatial) was identified as a reasonable model for summarizing performance in this sample (standardized root mean square residual = 0.05, root mean square error of approximation = 0.05, confirmatory fit index = 0.94).                                         Conclusions:               The HCAP battery conforms adequately to a multidimensional structure of neuropsychological performance. The derived measurement models can be used to operationalize notions of neurocognitive impairment, and as a starting point for prioritizing pre-statistical harmonization and evaluating configural invariance in cross-national research.},

  abstract = {The study of human individual differences has matured significantly, in the last decade or so owing, in part, to the notable advances in neuroimaging techniques. There are three major domains of inquiry within individual differences research: personality, creativity, and intelligence. Each has a discrete, testable definition (a new definition for intelligence is offered: rapid and accurate problem solving), and each has been associated with distinct brain regions and interactive networks. Here, we outline commonalities between these constructs, which appear to conform to two major axes: exploratory behavior and restraint. These axes, in turn, conform largely to two major brain networks dedicated to novelty generation (i.e. default mode network — DMN), and refinement of ideas (i.e. cognitive control network — CCN). Thus, human individual differences represent the expression of adaptive behaviors leading to exploratory and/or restrained action arising from brain structure and function.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Many educational systems are characterized by segregation between a general and vocational educational track. When adolescents must decide on their postcompulsory education at the end of lower secondary school, the different programs are typically embedded in one of these two main tracks. Prior career choice theories postulate that vocational interests, as structured by the six-dimensional RIASEC model of Holland (1997), play a crucial role in educational and vocational transition processes. However, regarding the question of general versus vocational education, previous studies have mainly focused on the effects of social background. Therefore, this paper examines the impact of vocational interests on the choice of Baccalaureate School (BAC, general track), Vocational Education and Training (VET, vocational track) or the Federal Vocational Baccalaureate (FVB), a hybrid qualification that links elements of both tracks. The sample consists of               N               \,=\,609 students at the end of lower secondary school in Switzerland. The results of multinomial logistic regression analyses show that all six dimensions of Holland’s interest model are significant predictors for the three postcompulsory tracks, even when controlling for school variables (e.g., grades) and variables of social background. While the               realistic               and               social               dimensions are positively interrelated with the choice of VET, the               artistic               ,               investigative               and               enterprising               dimensions predict the choice of BAC. The               conventional               dimension is the only one positively linked to the choice of FVB. The results are discussed with special attention to segregation between more practical and more theoretical types of interests.},

The present work aims to investigate the predictive value of epistemic trust—the capacity for social learning—on the mediating effect of personality functioning in the association of ACEs and PTSD/cPTSD.                                         Methods                                We conducted structural equation modeling (SEM) based on representative data of the German population (                 N                 = 2,004). Personality functioning (OPD-SQS) was applied as a mediator between ACEs and PTSD/cPTSD (ITQ), while epistemic trust (ETMCQ) was added as predictor for OPD-SQS. TLI, CFI, and RMSEA (95\%-CI) determined the models’ fit.                                                        Results                                N                 = 477 (23.8\%) participants reported at least one ACE and                 n                 = 218 (10.9\%) reported ≥4 ACEs. Fit indices were good for both PTSD (TLI = 0.96; CFI = 0.99; RMSEA = 0.06; 95\%CI: 0.041–0.078) and cPTSD (TLI = 0.96; CFI = 0.99; RMSEA = 0.06; 95\%CI: 0.043–0.081). ACEs were significantly associated with cPTSD (β = 0.44,                 p                 \&lt; 0.001) and PTSD (β = 0.29,                 p                 \&lt; 0.001), explaining 20 and 8\% of its variance. Adding personality functioning as a mediator increased the explained variance of cPTSD and PTSD to 47 and 19\% while the direct association between ACEs and cPTSD/PTSD decreased (β = 0.21/β = 0.17), thus, indicating a partial mediation. Including epistemic trust substantially increased the explained variance for personality functioning (41\%) compared to ACEs as a single predictor (16\%).                                                        Conclusion               We add to previous research emphasizing the association between ACEs and PTSD/cPTSD symptoms. Offering insights on underlying mechanisms, we show that epistemic trust and personality functioning are relevant mediators. Since both are modifiable by psychotherapy, knowledge about the role of these constructs can inform research on psychotherapeutic interventions and prevention.}

  abstract = {Because of the Flynn effect, IQ scores rise as a test norm ages but drop on the introduction of a newly revised test norm. The purpose of the current study was to determine the impact of the Flynn effect on learning disability (LD) diagnoses, the most prevalent special education diagnosis in the United States. Using a longitudinal sample of 875 school children who were initially diagnosed with LD on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children–Revised (WISC-R), children experienced a significant decline in IQ when retested on the third edition of the WISC (WISC-III) compared to peers who were tested on the WISC-R twice. Furthermore, results from logistic regression analyses revealed that the probability of a rediagnosis of LD on reevaluation significantly decreased, in part, because of this decline on the WISC-III. These results are discussed in terms of their implications for both basic research and educational policy.}

  abstract = {People’s minds sometimes wander from ongoing activities. Although these experiences can be pleasant and useful, they are often unintentional and precipitate mistakes. In this article, we adopt an individual-differences perspective in considering unwanted mind wandering as an indicator of both momentary failures of and enduring deficiencies in executive-control functions. We describe research that associates normal variation in working memory capacity (WMC)—a cognitive ability that broadly predicts intellectual capabilities and accomplishments—with off-task thinking. In laboratory and daily-life assessments, people with lower WMC mind wander more frequently than do those with higher WMC, at least during demanding tasks. Moreover, the error-proneness of lower-WMC subjects seems to arise partly from their vulnerability to mind wandering. Executive control over one’s thoughts therefore seems to contribute to the effective regulation of behavior.},

Reading comprehension was assessed with a multiple-choice task and online research and comprehension (ORC) with a problem-solving task. The analyses were controlled for gender, reading fluency and nonverbal reasoning. To investigate differences in students' performance between the tasks, comprehension skills in the multiple-choice task were also controlled for in the ORC task. Structural equation models showed that teacher-rated attention and EF difficulties were related to students' performance more in the problem-solving task than in the multiple-choice task. After controlling for all the background variables, these difficulties explained 9\% of the variance of ORC performance in girls and 4\% in boys. These results indicate that for students with attention and EF difficulties the ORC task was more challenging than the reading comprehension task.},

Experiment 1 examined the relationship between strategy knowledge, verbal WM, and visual-spatial WM in children with MD as a function of initial, gain, and maintenance conditions. The results showed that after partialing the influence of reading, stable strategy choices rather than specific strategy knowledge was related to verbal and visual-spatial WM span in high demand (maintenance) conditions. Experiment 2 compared children with MD to a group of chronological age-matched children and a group of math ability-matched children on the same conditions as Experiment 1. Age-matched children's verbal and visual-spatial WM performance was superior to that of children with MD, whereas WM performance was statistically comparable between children with MD and younger children matched on math ability. The selection of expert strategies was related to high WM span scores in the initial conditions. After controlling for reading achievement in a regression analysis, verbal and visual-spatial WM, stable verbal strategy choices, and expert strategy choices related to visual-spatial processing all contributed independent variance to math achievement. Overall, these results suggest that WM and math achievement are related to strategy knowledge.},

  abstract = {The Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children is a new, individually administered test designed to assess simultaneous and sequential mental processing and achievement in children ages 2 ½ to 12 ½. Factor analyses of the K-ABC standardization data generally offer support for the validity of the two mental processing scales, but analyses including the achievement tests have been considerably less supportive. For the present study, data from the standardization sample were used to test alternate structures for the K-ABC, based on the hypothesis that the test measures verbal memory skills, and verbal and nonverbal reasoning. Hierarchical factor models based on this structure were developed and tested using confirmatory techniques. Results suggest that the models fit the data fairly well, thus supporting the validity of this alternate structure. Of particular interest was the finding of the virtual equivalence of the verbal reasoning factor and the second order, or general ability, factor. It appears that users should exercise caution when interpreting K-ABC scores, especially scores on the K-ABC achievement scale.},

  abstract = {This chapter demonstrates the use of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to understand the constructs measured by modern intelligence tests. In one of the earliest examples of using CFA to test for invariance, multigroup-CFA was used to test for invariance of covariance structures. The chapter deals with a "simple" CFA model, and gradually moves to CFA methods that provide a more complete evaluation of the theories underlying tests (e.g., hierarchical analysis, the comparison of alternative models, testing hypotheses about tests and constructs, and multisample analyses). Before illustrating the comparison of competing alternative models, it is worth illustrating an alternative method of scaling the factors. The chapter shows an alternative model of the constructs measured by the Kaufman Adult and Adolescent Intelligence Test. Like a higher-order model, a bifactor model includes both general intelligence and more narrow abilities, but all are first-order factors. An individually administered test of intelligence will generally take an hour and a half to administer, and substantial sample sizes are needed.

HARKing is defined as presenting a post hoc hypothesis (i.e., one based on or informed by one's results) in one's research report as if it were, in fact, an a priori hypotheses. Several forms of HARKing are identified and survey data are presented that suggests that at least some forms of HARKing are widely practiced and widely seen as inappropriate. I identify several reasons why scientists might HARK. Then I discuss several reasons why scientists ought not to HARK. It is conceded that the question of whether HARKing's costs exceed its benefits is a complex one that ought to be addressed through research, open discussion, and debate. To help stimulate such discussion (and for those such as myself who suspect that HARKing's costs do exceed its benefits), I conclude the article with some suggestions for deterring HARKing.},

  abstract = {One of the most replicable findings in psychology is the positive manifold: the observation that individual differences in cognitive abilities are universally positively correlated. Investigating the developmental origin of the positive manifold is crucial to understanding it. In a large longitudinal cohort of adolescents and young adults ( N = 784; n = 563 across two waves, mean interval between waves = 1.48 years; age range = 14–25 years), we examined developmental changes in two core cognitive domains, fluid reasoning and vocabulary. We used bivariate latent change score models to compare three leading accounts of cognitive development: g-factor theory, investment theory, and mutualism. We showed that a mutualism model, which proposes that basic cognitive abilities directly and positively interact during development, provides the best account of developmental changes. We found that individuals with higher scores in vocabulary showed greater gains in matrix reasoning and vice versa. These dynamic coupling pathways are not predicted by other accounts and provide a novel mechanistic window into cognitive development.},

  abstract = {The authors propose an integrative theoretical model of reading called the direct and indirect effects model of reading (DIER) that builds on and extends several prominent theoretical models of reading. According to DIER, the following skills and knowledge are involved in reading comprehension: word reading, listening comprehension, text reading fluency, background knowledge (content knowledge and discourse knowledge), reading affect or socioemotions, higher order cognitions and regulation (e.g., inference, perspective taking, reasoning, and comprehension monitoring), vocabulary, grammatical (morphosyntactic and syntactic) knowledge, phonology, morphology, orthography, and domain–general cognitions (e.g., working memory and attentional control). Importantly, DIER also describes the nature of structural relations—component skills are hypothesized to have (a) hierarchical relations; (b) dynamic (or differential) relations as a function of text, activity (including assessment), and development; and (c) interactive relations. The authors then examined the hierarchical relations hypothesis by comparing a flat or direct relations model with hierarchical relations (or direct and indirect effects) models. Structural equation model results from 201 Korean-speaking first graders supported the hierarchical relations hypothesis and revealed multichanneled direct and indirect effects of component skills. These results are discussed in light of DIER, including instructional and assessment implications for reading development and reading difficulties.},

Results from 350 English-speaking second graders revealed that language and cognitive component skills had direct and indirect relations to listening comprehension, explaining 86\% of variance. Word reading and listening comprehension completely mediated the relations of language and cognitive component skills to reading comprehension and explained virtually all the variance in reading comprehension. Total effects of component skills varied from small to substantial. The findings support the direct and indirect effects model of reading model and indicate that word reading and listening comprehension are upper-level skills that are built on multiple language and cognitive component skills, which have direct and indirect relations among themselves.

Participants, ages 5 to 18, were selected from the KTEA-3 standardization sample if they met one of two PSW profiles: high crystallized ability (Gc) paired with low processing speed/long-term retrieval (Gs/Glr; n = 375) or high Gs/Glr paired with low Gc (n = 309). Estimates of Gc and Gs/Glr were based on five KTEA-3 subtests that measure either Gc (e.g., Listening Comprehension) or Gs/Glr (e.g., Object Naming Facility). The two groups were then compared on math error factors. Significant differences favored the High-Gc group for factors that measure math calculation, basic math concepts, and complex computation. However, the two groups did not differ in their errors on factors that measure geometry/measurement or simple addition. Results indicated that students with different PSW profiles also differed in the kinds of errors they made on math tests.}

  abstract = {Traditional diagnostic systems went beyond empirical evidence on the structure of mental health. Consequently, these diagnoses do not depict psychopathology accurately, and their validity in research and utility in clinicalpractice are therefore limited. The Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) consortium proposed a model based on structural evidence. It addresses problems of diagnostic heterogeneity, comorbidity, and unreliability. We review the HiTOP model, supporting evidence, and conceptualization of psychopathology in this hierarchical dimensional framework. The system is not yet comprehensive, and we describe the processes for improving and expanding it. We summarize data on the ability of HiTOP to predict and explain etiology (genetic, environmental, and neurobiological), risk factors, outcomes, and treatment response. We describe progress in the development of HiTOP-based measures and in clinical implementation of the system. Finally, we review outstanding challenges and the research agenda. HiTOP is of practical utility already, and its ongoing development will produce a transformative map of psychopathology.},

  abstract = {For more than a century, the standard view in the field of human intelligence has been that there is a “general intelligence” that permeates all human cognitive activity. This general cognitive ability is supposed to explain the positive manifold, the finding that intelligence tests with different content all correlate. Yet there is a lack of consensus regarding the psychological or neural basis of such an ability. A recent account, process-overlap theory, explains the positive manifold without proposing general intelligence. As a consequence of the theory, IQ is redefined as an emergent formative construct rather than a reflective latent trait. This implies that IQ should be interpreted as an index of specific cognitive abilities rather than the reflection of an underlying general cognitive ability.},

Lower scores on mathematics and several cognitive skills have been revealed in samples with MLD compared with those with typical development (TD), but these studies vary in sample selection, making it difficult to generalize conclusions. Furthermore, many studies have investigated only one or few cognitive skills, making it difficult to compare their relative discrepancies. The current meta-analysis (k = 145) was conducted to (a) give a state-of-the-art overview of the mathematical and cognitive skills associated with MLD and (b) investigate how selection criteria influence conclusions regarding this topic. Results indicated that people with MLD display lower scores not only on mathematics but also on number sense, working memory, and rapid automatized naming compared with those with TD, in general independently of the criteria used to define MLD. A profile that distinguishes people with more serious, persistent, or specific MLD from those with less severe MLD was not detected.},

Students were grouped as adequate or inadequate responders, using as the cut‐point the control‐group mean on pre‐to‐post improvement on the relevant measure. Between‐group differences identified reasoning, concept formation, and listening comprehension related to all 3 fraction outcomes. On the number‐line outcome, within‐group profile analysis indicated that inadequate responders experienced low reasoning ability relative to their other forms of cognitive processing.},

  abstract = {Existing research has mainly examined the role of cognitive correlates of early reading and mathematics from a stationary perspective that does not consider how these skills unfold and interact over time. This approach constraints the interpretation of cross-domain associations and the specificity of domain-specific covariates. In this study, we disentangle the role of these predictors and investigate cross-domain associations between reading, math, and two related domain-specific predictors (phonological awareness and fluency with number sets) over the kindergarten years (n=512, Mage=54months, SDage=3.5, 52\% females). Results reveal that the overlap between reading and math skills changes over development. Reciprocal associations between reading and math abilities are observed at earlier stages; then, reading abilities become the lead force. Findings also show that phonological awareness and fluency with number sets are domain-specific predictors that do not contribute to cross-domain gains in academic skills. Indeed, there is a trend for domain-specific skills to be more strongly related to achievement at the beginning of formal education than at the beginning of kindergarten, which suggests an increasing differentiation of domains over the kindergarten years. Such findings have implications for the timing and nature of interventions that aim to support children’s reading and mathematical development.}

  abstract = {Objective: Engaging youth and caregivers as active collaborators in the treatment planning process is a patient-centered approach with the potential to facilitate the personalization of established evidence-based treatments. This study is the first randomized clinical trial to evaluate shared decision-making (SDM) to plan youth psychotherapy. Method: Forty youth (7–15 years; 33\% ethnic minority) were randomly assigned to psychosocial treatment planned using SDM (n = 20) or planned primarily by the clinician (n = 20). In the SDM condition, clinicians guided youth and caregivers through a collaborative treatment planning process that relies on research findings to inform three primary decisions: (a) treatment target problem(s), (b) treatment participants, and (c) treatment techniques. Assessments occurred at baseline, following treatment planning, midtreatment, and post-treatment. Results: Youth and caregivers in the SDM condition reported significantly greater involvement in the treatment planning process compared to their counterparts in the clinician-guided condition (U = 123.00, p = .037; U = 84.50, p = .014, respectively) and SDM caregivers reported significantly lower decisional conflict (U = 72.00, p = .004) and decisional regret (U = 73.50, p = .020). Supporting the feasibility of successful SDM implementation, there were no significant differences between conditions on treatment length, satisfaction with decisions, or engagement. There were no significant diagnostic or symptom differences between conditions. Conclusions: Planning psychosocial treatments in collaboration with youth and caregivers is a promising way to support youth and caregiver autonomy and plan evidence-based treatments that are responsive to patient preferences, culture, and values.

Se analizaron las FE y la MI con los test de Laberintos de Porteus y el test de Goodenough respectivamente. En la evolución de las variables cognitivas y de condición física según la edad de los niños, se observan diferencias significativas entre los grupos de edad. La velocidad de desplazamiento junto con la dinamometría manual y el tiempo de reacción son variables que se asocian a las FE y a la MI. Por tanto, existe un paralelismo evolutivo entre el desarrollo de la FE y MI con el desarrollo de la condición física.}

This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the contexts in which SPT interventions have been conducted, the methodological adequacy of the research assessing its effects, and the outcomes for both peer implementers and focal children. Studies have primarily occurred in inclusive preschool settings during free play activities, with researchers serving as facilitators. Average effects were positive and substantial for both peer implementers and focal children, although considerable heterogeneity across studies was observed. Additional research is needed to determine what peer implementer and focal child characteristics moderate intervention success, what modifications are needed for children who have complex communication needs, and optimal procedural variations (e.g., group size, training time).},

  abstract = {IQ scores are often used to predict school performance. However, for children with learning disabilities, the predictive validity of IQ scores appears to be low. In the fourth and fifth versions of the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children (WISC), new ancillary indices were introduced. The General Ability Index (GAI) is a broad measure of fluid reasoning with verbal, visual–spatial, and figural test items. By contrast, the Cognitive Proficiency Index (CPI) combines different executive functions known to be frequently affected in children with dyslexia, ADHD, or combined learning disorders. To date, there is little evidence to demonstrate that these measures improve the prediction of school performance beyond the Full-scale IQ (FSIQ). We therefore used lasso regression to explore the predictive validity of these measures for school grades. The analyzed samples were taken from the German standardization samples of the WISC-IV and the WISC-V. In most cases, the prediction of school performance was not considerably improved by taking the GAI or the CPI into account. However, when the individual discrepancy between the CPI and the GAI was high, the FSIQ lost its predictive validity in elementary school. In this subgroup of children, reading and writing skills were best predicted by the CPI, whereas math skills were limited by the lowest score (i.e., the minimum out of the CPI and the GAI).},

The relative importance of different language skills for the development of listening and reading comprehension remains unclear. In this 5-year longitudinal study, starting at age 7.5 years (n = 198), it was found that the shared variance between vocabulary, grammar, verbal working memory, and inference skills was a powerful longitudinal predictor of variations in both listening and reading comprehension. In line with the simple view of reading, listening comprehension, and word decoding, together with their interaction and curvilinear effects, explains almost all (96\%) variation in early reading comprehension skills. Additionally, listening comprehension was a predictor of both the early and later growth of reading comprehension skills.},

  abstract = {The analysis of psychological networks in previous research has been limited to the inspection of centrality measures and the quantification of specific global network features. The main idea of this paper is that a psychological network entails more potentially useful and interesting information that can be reaped by other methods widely used in network science. Specifically, we suggest methods that provide clearer picture about hierarchical arrangement of nodes in the network, address heterogeneity of nodes in the network, and look more closely at network’s local structure. We explore the potential value of minimum spanning trees, participation coefficients, and motif analyses and demonstrate the relevant analyses using a network of 26 psychological attributes. Using these techniques, we investigate how the network of different psychological concepts is organized, which attribute is most central, and what the role of intelligence in the network is relative to other psychological variables. Applying the three methods, we arrive at several tentative conclusions. Trait Empathy is the most “central” attribute in the network. Intelligence, although peripheral, is weakly but equally related to different kinds of attributes present in the network. Analysis of triadic configurations additionally shows that the network is characterized by relatively strong open triads and an unusually frequent occurrence of negative triangles. We discuss these and other findings in the light of possible theoretical explanations, methodological limitations, and future research.},

However, to advance dimensional nosology and construct validation of the p factor, this body of research needs to be synthesized. This study focuses on the p factor as a substantive construct by testing its consistency across samples and models. Bifactor analyses were run for three large epidemiological and clinical data sets: National Comorbidity Survey, Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys, and Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services. Despite generally good model fit and strong factor congruence, interpretation of the p factor varied across samples and methods. This limited consistency suggests a lack of clear, generalizable operationalization of the p factor for applications such as measure development. Results are interpreted in terms of implications for the p factor as a substantive construct.},

  abstract = {People with high levels of intelligence are more aware of risk factors, therefore choosing a healthier lifestyle. This assumption seems reasonable, but is it true? Previous studies appear to agree and disagree. To cope with the uncertainty, we designed a mendelian randomization (MR) study to examine the causal effects of genetically proxied intelligence on alcohol-, smoking-, and physical activity (PA)-related behaviors. We obtained genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets concerning these variables from separate studies or biobanks and used inverse-variance weighted (IVW) or MR-Egger estimator to evaluate the causal effects according to an MR protocol. The MR-Egger intercept test, MR-PRESSO, and funnel plots were employed for horizontal pleiotropy diagnosis. The Steiger test (with reliability test), Cochran’s Q test, MR-PRESSO, and leave-one-out method were employed for sensitivity analysis. We found significant or potential effects of intelligence on alcohol dependence (OR = 0.749, p = 0.003), mental and behavioral disorders due to alcohol (OR = 0.814, p = 0.009), smoking (OR = 0.585, p = 0.005), and smoking cessation (OR = 1.334, p = 0.001). Meanwhile, we found significant or potential effects on walking duration (B = −0.066, p {$<$} 0.001), walking frequency (B = −0.055, p = 0.031), moderate PA frequency (B = −0.131, p {$<$} 0.001), and vigorous PA frequency (B = −0.070, p = 0.001), but all in a negative direction. In conclusion, our findings reinforce some existing knowledge, indicate the complexity of the health impacts of human intelligence, and underline the value of smoking and alcohol prevention in less intelligent populations. Given the existing limitations in this study, particularly the potential reverse causality in some estimations, re-examinations are warranted in future research.},

Among all sensory biomarkers, olfaction is currently one of the most promising indicators for AD. Olfactory dysfunction signifies a decline in the ability to detect, identify, or remember odors. Within the spectrum of AD, impairment in olfactory identification precedes detectable cognitive impairments, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and even the stage of subjective cognitive decline (SCD), by several years. Olfactory impairment is closely linked to the clinical symptoms and neuropathological biomarkers of AD, accompanied by significant structural and functional abnormalities in the brain. Olfactory behavior examination can subjectively evaluate the abilities of olfactory identification, threshold, and discrimination. Olfactory functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can provide a relatively objective assessment of olfactory capabilities, with the potential to become a promising tool for exploring the neural mechanisms of olfactory damage in AD. Here, we provide a timely review of recent literature on the characteristics, neuropathology, and examination of olfactory dysfunction in the AD continuum. We focus on the early changes in olfactory indicators detected by behavioral and fMRI assessments and discuss the potential of these techniques in MCI and preclinical AD. Despite the challenges and limitations of existing research, olfactory dysfunction has demonstrated its value in assessing neurodegenerative diseases and may serve as an early indicator of AD in the future.}

  abstract = {The random intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) is an extension of the traditional cross-lagged panel model (CLPM) that allows controlling for stable trait factors when estimating cross-lagged effects. It has been argued that the RI-CLPM more appropriately accounts for trait-like, time-invariant stability of many psychological constructs and that it should be preferred over the CLPM when at least three waves of measurement are available. The basic idea of the RI-CLPM is to decompose longitudinal associations between two constructs into stable between-person associations and temporal within-person dynamics. The present article critically examines the RI-CLPM from a causal inference perspective. Using formal analysis and simulated data, we show that the RI-CLPM has limited potential to control for unobserved stable confounder variables when estimating cross-lagged effects. The CLPM with additional lag-2 effects sufficiently controls for delayed effects, as long as all relevant covariates are measured. Furthermore, we clarify that, in general, the RI-CLPM targets a different causal estimand than the CLPM. Whereas the cross-lagged effect in the CLPM targets the effect of increasing the exposure by one unit, the within-person cross-lagged effect in the RI-CLPM provides an estimate of the effect of increasing the exposure by one unit around the person mean. We argue that this within-person causal effect is typically less relevant for testing causal hypotheses with longitudinal data because it only captures temporary fluctuations around the individual person means and ignores the potential effects of causes that explain differences between persons.}

  abstract = {SCIENTIFIC  Research in social embodied cognition has found numerous positive associations between higher temperatures and prosocial behavior, with “warmer is better” effects demonstrating greater altruism, social proximity, and affective attributions. However, recent failures to replicate experimental findings in this area have called some effects into question. By contrast, epidemiological research has frequently observed that higher ambient temperatures are correlated with increases in societal volatility and antisocial behaviors, with “warmer is worse” effects demonstrated by increases in warfare, city-center rioting, and sporting aggression. Using a sample size (N = 611) larger than many previous studies in the social priming domain, we examined whether higher ambient temperature and/or higher prop temperature (i.e., holding a hot/cold therapeutic pack) lead to more prosocial behavior. Results showed that warmer ambient temperatures were weakly associated with more prosocial than selfish choices. However, calculation of Bayes Factors suggests that the evidence is better characterized as inconclusive. As previously published analyses of the same data set used in this study show (Lynott et al., 2014), prop temperature did not lead to increased prosocial responding, which fails to support predictions from particular accounts of social embodiment. We discuss possible reasons for the inconclusive findings and for the broad range of effect sizes observed more generally in the literature.

The presence of thresholds means that when students fall below that threshold, their proficiency in that component skill of reading is not sufficient for there to be a relationship with comprehension performance. The present study assessed (a) whether there were thresholds in proficiencies in foundational skills, (b) whether students falling below the thresholds were disproportionately in developmental literary programs (i.e., institutionally designated as underprepared), and (c) the implications of being below the thresholds on engaging in strategic processing during reading. College students were administered assessments of foundational literacy skills, text comprehension, and strategic processing of texts. The sample included students who were enrolled in developmental literacy programs and students who were not. Thresholds were found in the foundational skills associated with word-, sentence-, and discourse-level processing. Participants below these thresholds were represented disproportionately by students determined to be underprepared for college and assigned to developmental literacy programs. Finally, students falling below the thresholds demonstrated lower reading strategy scores than students above the threshold.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Performance in everyday spatial orientation tasks (e.g., map reading and navigation) has been considered functionally separate from performance on more abstract object-based spatial abilities (e.g., mental rotation and visualization). However, few studies have examined the link between spatial orientation and object-based spatial skills, and even fewer have done so including a wide range of spatial tests. To examine this issue and more generally to test the structure of spatial ability, we used a novel gamified battery to assess six tests of spatial orientation in a virtual environment and examined their association with ten object-based spatial tests, as well as their links to general cognitive ability (               g               ). We further estimated the role of genetic and environmental factors in underlying variation and covariation in these spatial tests. Participants (               N               \,=\,2660; aged 19–22) were part of the Twins Early Development Study. The six tests of spatial orientation clustered into a single ‘               Navigation’               factor that was 64\% heritable. Examining the structure of spatial ability across all 16 tests, three, substantially correlated, factors emerged:               Navigation               ,               Object Manipulation               , and               Visualization               . These, in turn, loaded strongly onto a general factor of               Spatial Ability               , which was highly heritable (84\%). A large portion (45\%) of this high heritability was independent of               g               . The results point towards the existence of a common genetic network that supports all spatial abilities.},

  abstract = {The               Oxford Handbook of Treatment Processes and Outcomes in Psychology               presents a multidisciplinary approach to a biopsychosocial, translational model of psychological treatment across the life span. It describes cutting edge research across developmental, clinical, counseling, and school psychology; social work; neuroscience; and psychopharmacology. The               Handbook               emphasizes the development of individual differences in resilience and mental health concerns, including social, environmental, and epigenetic influences across the life span, particularly during childhood. The               Handbook               is a primer for practitioners and researchers, and is a guide for clinics and oversight bodies responsible for decision making regarding training of staff and the evaluation of treatment effectiveness. The               Handbook               is appropriate reading for students in graduate programs in psychology, social work, and counseling. This               Handbook               presents work by experts from multiple disciplines to readers who otherwise might have difficulty gaining direct access to the works by these authors. Detailed discussions are offered that expand on areas of research and practice that already have a substantive research base, such as self-regulation, resilience, defining evidence-based treatment, and describing client-related variables that influence treatment processes. The               Handbook               also includes chapters devoted to newer areas of research (e.g., neuroimaging, medications as adjuncts to psychological treatment, and the placebo effect). Additionally, it includes chapters that address treatment outcomes, such as evaluating therapist effectiveness, examining treatment outcomes from different perspectives, and assessing the length of treatment necessary to achieve clinical improvement. The               Handbook               provides entrée into research as well as “hands on” guidance and suggestions for practice and oversight, making it a valuable resource for graduate students, seasoned practitioners, researchers, and agencies alike.},

  abstract = {To date, there remains no consensus about the best evidence-based method for integrating multiple informant data in the diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Several approaches exist, including the psychometrically sound approach of averaging scores, as well as the use of “OR” and “AND” algorithms, which are still commonly used in research. The current study tested these major integration methods in their concurrent and longitudinal prediction of clinician-rated impairment, teacher-rated academic, and parent- and self-rated social skill ratings in children overrecruited for ADHD across a 6-year span from childhood to adolescence. The sample included a total of 800 children, 480 with ADHD, ages 6 to 13, who completed a “gold standard” assessment of ADHD and associated impairment. Overall, the “OR,” “AND,” and average integration approaches showed significantly high interrelations with one another (r range from .78 to .96) and were all significantly and strongly related to impairment measures concurrently and longitudinally. Multivariate regressions demonstrated that the average integration approach concurrently and longitudinally out predicted the other two approaches. Results demonstrated that the average approach slightly outperformed the other two in its prediction of concurrent and longitudinal clinician-rated impairment, teacher-rated academic skills, and parent- and self-rated child social skills across childhood and adolescence. Evidence-based assessment integration of parent and teacher ratings of ADHD in childhood might best utilize an averaging approach, as it is most related to later impairment ratings, particularly if such findings are replicated by other groups.

What explains individual differences in these real-world outcomes? This chapter shows how individual differences in intelligence, and particularly working memory capacity, attention control, and fluid intelligence, are related to life success. It begins by discussing the executive attention view, which treats attention control as a central factor underpinning individual differences in working memory capacity and fluid intelligence. After describing the theoretical framework, it reviews evidence revealing how individual differences in these cognitive abilities, and intelligence more broadly defined, relate to life outcomes in the domains of academic achievement, job performance, physical health, mortality, and psychological well-being. It also speculates about mechanisms that might mediate these relationships and discuss confounding variables such as environmental inequality that challenge the ability to disentangle the effects of intelligence from the effects of the environment. The chapter concludes by suggesting avenues for future research.},

With the use of representative data sets, including the WISC-R national standardization sample, purely ipsatized (or deviational ipsative) subtest scores were contrasted with conventional norm-based scores in terms of the evidential and consequential bases for validity. Internal and external evidence for validity was assessed for relative convergence of ability attributes, short- and long-term stability, and predictive efficiency. Comparative utility of each type of measure was explored for theoretical relevance, applicability in measurement work, and assessment of individualized intervention outcomes. Ipsative ability measures were found to be uniformly inferior to their normative counterparts, with ipsative measures conveying no uniquely useful information and otherwise impeding the versatility of assessment.},

To wit, Hale et al. (Psychology in the Schools, 45, 838–858, (2008)) posit that cognitive scatter is a defining characteristic of specific learning disability and that individuals with learning disabilities may have higher levels of scatter compared to normal controls. To investigate the tenability of this claim, the present study employed diagnostic efficiency statistics and other recommended psychometric methods (e.g., receiver operative characteristic curve, Bayesian nomogram) to test whether cognitive scatter could accurately distinguish between individuals with and without a known learning disability (LD) diagnosis in the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children-Second Edition KABC-II; Kaufman and Kaufman (2004a) normative sample. Results indicated that increasing levels of cognitive profile scatter identified individuals with LD at no better than chance levels. The current negative results add to a growing corpus of research questioning the utility of many of the interpretive procedures that are utilized by school psychologists for commercial ability measures. In particular, it is suggested that clinicians who interpret cognitive profile scatter may risk diagnostic overconfidence and in the case of LD identification, unacceptable levels of false positive decisions attributable to error. Implications for evidence-based assessment in school psychology are discussed.},

This debate has resulted in strong support for a method that appraises an individual’s profile of cognitive test scores for the purposes of determining cognitive processing strengths and weaknesses, commonly referred to as patterns of strengths and weaknesses (PSW). Following the Fuchs and Deshler model, questions regarding the psychometric and conceptual integrity of the PSW model are addressed. Despite the strong claims made by many PSW proponents, the findings by this review demonstrate the need for additional information to determine whether PSW is a viable alternative to existing eligibility models and worthy for large scale adoption for SLD identification. Implications for public policy and future SLD research are also discussed.},

Accordingly, the present study employed diagnostic utility statistics to determine whether the presence of a significant cognitive weakness accurately distinguishes between participants with and without academic weaknesses ages 7 years 0 months to 18 years 11 months in the linked Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children–Second Edition (Kaufman \& Kaufman, 2004a) and Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement–Second Edition (Kaufman \& Kaufman, 2004b) normative sample. Sensitivity and positive predictive values for the CHC-related broad abilities ranged from low to moderate, indicating that a cognitive weakness may not be robust a rule-in indicator for the presence of an academic weakness. Conversely, specificity and negative predictive values were consistently high, indicating that, absent a cognitive weakness, it is unlikely that an individual will present with an academic weakness.

To investigate the tenability of this popular interpretive heuristic, the present study examined the structural and predictive validity of the KABC-II for participants in the normative sample who were observed to have significant variability in their factor scores. Participants were children and adolescents, ages 7-18, (N = 2,025) drawn from the KABC-II/KTEA-II standardization sample. The sample was nationally stratified and proportional to U.S. census estimates for sex, ethnicity, geographic region, and parent education level. Using exploratory factor analysis and multiple factor extraction criteria, support for a five-factor extraction was obtained consistent with publisher theory. As recommended by Carroll (1993; 1995) hierarchical structure was explicated by sequentially partitioning variance appropriately to higher- and lower-order dimensions. Results showed the largest portions of total and common variance were accounted for by the second-order general factor with meaningful residual variance accounted for by Short-Term Memory at ages 7-12 and 13-18. As a result, the Fluid-Crystallized Index (FCI) accounted for large predictive effects across measures of academic achievement whereas the five first-order CHC factor scores consistently accounted for trivial proportions of incremental predictive variance beyond the FCI. Implications for clinical practice and the correct interpretation of the KABC-II and other related measurement instruments in the presence of significant scatter are discussed.},

  abstract = {Carroll’s treatise on the structure of human cognitive abilities is a milestone in psychometric intelligence research. Thirty years later, Carroll’s work continues to influence research on intelligence theories and the development and interpretation of intelligence tests. A historical review of the relations between the 3S and CHC theories necessitates the recommendation that the theories of Cattell, Horn, and Carroll be reframed as a family of obliquely correlated CHC theories—not a single CHC theory. Next, a previously unpublished Carroll exploratory factor analysis of 46 cognitive and achievement tests is presented. A complimentary bifactor analysis is presented that reinforces Carroll’s conclusion that his 3S model more accurately represents the structure of human intelligence than two prominent alternative models. Finally, a Carroll-recommended higher-stratum psychometric network analysis (PNA) of CHC cognitive, reading, and math variables is presented. The PNA results demonstrate how PNA can complement factor analysis and serve as a framework for identifying and empirically evaluating cognitive–achievement causal relations and mechanisms (e.g., developmental cascade and investment theories), with an eye toward improved cognitive–achievement intervention research. It is believed that Carroll, given his long-standing interest in school learning, would welcome the integration of theory-driven factor and PNA research.},

The central tenet of this article is that SPs need to integrate motivation alongside affective and cognitive constructs vis-à-vis an updated trilogy-of-the-mind (cognitive, conative, affective) model of intellectual functioning. CAMML builds on Richard Snow’s seminal research on academic aptitudes—which are not synonymous with cognitive abilities. Learning aptitude complexes are academic domain-specific cognitive abilities and personal investment mechanisms (motivation and self-regulation) that collectively produce a student’s readiness to learn in a specific domain. CAMML incorporates the “crossing the Rubicon” commitment pathway model of motivated self-regulated learning. It is recommended SPs take a fresh look at motivation theory, constructs, and research, embedded in the CAMML aptitude framework, by going back-to-the-future guided by the wisdom of giants from the field of cognition, intelligence, and educational psychology.},

  abstract = {It has been claimed that working memory training programs produce diverse beneficial effects. This article presents a meta-analysis of working memory training studies (with a pretest-posttest design and a control group) that have examined transfer to other measures (nonverbal ability, verbal ability, word decoding, reading comprehension, or arithmetic; 87 publications with 145 experimental comparisons). Immediately following training there were reliable improvements on measures of intermediate transfer (verbal and visuospatial working memory). For measures of far transfer (nonverbal ability, verbal ability, word decoding, reading comprehension, arithmetic) there was no convincing evidence of any reliable improvements when working memory training was compared with a treated control condition. Furthermore, mediation analyses indicated that across studies, the degree of improvement on working memory measures was not related to the magnitude of far-transfer effects found. Finally, analysis of publication bias shows that there is no evidential value from the studies of working memory training using treated controls. The authors conclude that working memory training programs appear to produce short-term, specific training effects that do not generalize to measures of “real-world” cognitive skills. These results seriously question the practical and theoretical importance of current computerized working memory programs as methods of training working memory skills.},

However, the neural deficits of auditory phonological processing remain unknown in English-as-the-second-language (ESL) learners with reading difficulties. Here we investigated neural responses during spoken word rhyme judgments in typical and impaired ESL readers in China. The impaired readers showed comparable activation in the left superior temporal gyrus (LSTG), but reduced activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) and left fusiform and reduced connectivity between the LSTG and left fusiform when compared to typical readers. These findings suggest that impaired ESL readers have relative intact representations but impaired manipulation of phonology and reduced or absent automatic access to orthographic representations. This is consistent with previous findings in native English speakers and suggests a common neural mechanism underlying English impairment across the L1 and L2 learners.},

Scores less than 29 on the ICMI had very good negative predictive power. ICMI scores were also used to form a group of fantasizers (n = 30) and a control group (n = 30). Fantasizers were much more likely to produce MMPI codes associated with a vulnerability to schizophrenia (70\%) than were controls (3.33\%). Although most controls(70\%) produced non-elevated MMPI scores, 66.67\% of the fantasizers produced three or more elevated clinical scales on the MMPI. The modal MMPI profile for the fantasizers was an 8-9 code, indicating that fantasizers appear at heightened risk for eccentric thinking and a Cluster A or B personality organization.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to use multidimensional scaling (MDS) to investigate relations among scores from the standardization sample of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children–Fifth edition (WISC-V; Wechsler, 2014). Nonmetric two-dimensional MDS maps were selected for interpretation. The most cognitively complex subtests and indexes were located near the center of the maps. Subtests were also grouped together in the way that they are organized in the primary and complementary indexes, and not necessarily on content surface features. Naming Speed and Symbol Translation scores may be better off kept as separate indexes, and Digit Span Sequencing appeared to add more complexity to the Digit Span subtest. One implication related to score interpretation is that General Ability Index (GAI) and Cognitive Proficiency Index (CPI) may be distinguished by the level of complexity of the subtests included in each index (i.e., more complex subtests included in GAI and less complex subtests included in the CPI).},

  abstract = {This article addresses the nature of dyslexia and best practices for identification and treatment within the context of multitier systems of support (MTSS). We initially review proposed definitions of dyslexia to identify key commonalities and differences in proposed attributes. We then review empirical evidence for proposed definitional attributes, focusing on key sources of controversy, including the role of IQ, instructional response, as well as issues of etiology and immutability. We argue that current empirical evidence supports a dyslexia classification marked by specific deficits in reading and spelling words combined with inadequate response to evidence-based instruction. We then propose a “hybrid” dyslexia identification process built to gather data relevant to these markers of dyslexia. We argue that this assessment process is best implemented within school-wide MTSS because it leverages data routinely collected in well-implemented MTSS, including documentation of student progress and fidelity of implementation. In contrast with other proposed methods for learning disability (LD) identification, the proposed “hybrid” method demonstrates strong evidence for valid decision-making and directly informs intervention.},

Three PSW models were examined for their ability to predict expert identified specific learning disabilities cases. The Dual Discrepancy/Consistency Model (DD/C; Flanagan, Ortiz, \&amp; Alfonso, 2013) as operationalized by the Cross Battery Assessment Software (X-BASS; Ortiz, Flanagan \&amp; Alfonso, 2015), the Concordance-Discordance Model (C-DM; Hale \&amp; Fiorello, 2004), and the Psychological Processing Analyzer software (PPA v3.1; Dehn, 2015b) were evaluated. The DD/C approach as represented with the X-BASS system had a 100\% agreement with the expert panel in the identification of specific learning disabilities and non-specific learning disabilities cases. The C-DM model was more conservative, identifying only 45\% of the specific learning disabilities cases. The PPA software was too limited to be used in the study and is not recommended for use in identifying specific learning disabilities via a PSW approach. Although more research is needed, the results of this study would suggest that the DD/C and X-BASS provide the greatest utility for a PSW approach to identifying specific learning disabilities.},

As the CI is utilized in a multitude of different types of information and evidence gathering scenarios the way in which the CI needs to be applied, and thus trained, should reflect the context within which it is to be used in the field. Accordingly, the UK has developed the ‘Tiered approach’ to interview training (Clarke, Milne, \& Bull, 2011), whereby interviewers learn interviewing skills (including the CI) incrementally, across a police investigator’s career span. This approach has been adopted in numerous countries and the chapter will explain the approach, outline a model of training to maximize transference of skills into the workplace, and the research base examining its effectiveness in the field.},

  abstract = {Spatial ability is important for success in STEM fields but is typically measured using a small number of tests that were not developed in the STEM context, have not been normed with recent samples, or have not been subjected to modern psychometric analyses. Here, an approach to developing valid, reliable, and efficient computer-based tests of spatial skills is proposed and illustrated via the development of an efficient test of the ability to visualize cross-sections of three-dimensional (3D) objects. After pilot testing, three measures of this ability were administered online to 498 participants (256 females, aged 18–20). Two of the measures, the Santa Barbara Solids and Planes of Reference tests had good psychometric properties and measured a domain-general ability to visualize cross-sections, with sub-factors related to item difficulty. Item-level statistics informed the development of the refined versions of these tests and a combined measure composed of the most informative test items. Sex and ethnicity had no significant effects on the combined measure after controlling for mathematics education, verbal ability, and age. The measures ofcross-sectioning ability developed in the context of geology education were found to be too difficult, likely because they measured domain knowledge in addition to cross-sectioning ability. Recommendations are made for the use of cross-section tests in selection and training and for the more general development of spatial ability measures.},

A cognitive strategy instruction that encouraged planning was provided to the group of 19 students with learning disabilities and mild mental impairments. All students completed math worksheets during 7 baseline and 14 intervention sessions. During the intervention phase, students engaged in self-reflection and verbalization of strategies about how the arithmetic computation worksheets should be completed. The sample was sorted into one experimental and four contrast groups after the experiment was completed. There were four groups with a cognitive weakness in each PASS scale from the Cognitive Assessment System and one group with no cognitive weakness. The results showed that children with a cognitive weakness in Planning improved considerably (large effect size of 1.4), in contrast to those with a cognitive weakness in Attention (small effect size of 0.3), Simultaneous weakness (a slight deterioration and effect size of -0.2), Successive weakness (medium effect size of 0.4), and no cognitive weakness (small effect size of .2). These data showed that children with a Planning weakness benefitted from the instruction designed to help them be more plaful. Those childrne who received the planning-based instruction who were not low inplanning did not show the same level of improvement.},

A cognitive instruction that facilitated planning was provided to a group of 12 students with learning disabilities. All students completed math work sheets during 7 sessions of baseline and 21 sessions of intervention (when the instruction designed to facilitate planning was provided). During the intervention phase, students engaged in self-reflection and verbalization of strategies about how mathematics problems were completed. The class was sorted according to planning scores, obtained using the Cognitive Assessment System, which is based on Planning, Attention, Simultaneous, Successive (PASS) theory; and low- and high-planning contrast groups were identified. The results, consistent with previous research, showed that teaching control and regulation of cognitive activity had beneficial effects for all students but was especially helpful for those who were poor in planning, as defined by the PASS theory.

  abstract = {Abstract             In the human brain, myelination of axons continues until early adulthood and is thought to be important for the development of cognitive functions during childhood. We used diffusion tensor MR imaging and calculated fractional anisotropy, an indicator of myelination and axonal thickness, in children aged between 8 and 18 years. Development of working memory capacity was positively correlated with fractional anisotropy in two regions in the left frontal lobe, including a region between the superior frontal and parietal cortices.             Reading ability, on the other hand, was only correlated with fractional anisotropy in the left temporal lobe, in the same white matter region where adults with reading disability are known to have lower fractional anisotropy. Both the temporal and the frontal regions were also correlated with age. These results show that maturation of white matter is an important part of brain maturation during childhood, and that maturation of relatively restricted regions of white matter is correlated with development of specific cognitive functions.},

Throughout the past several decades, psychological essentialism has emerged as an extremely active area of research in cognitive science. More recently, it has also attracted attention from philosophers, who put the empirical results to use in many different philosophical areas, ranging from philosophy of mind and cognitive science to social philosophy. This article aims to give philosophers who are new to the topic an overview of the key empirical findings surrounding psychological essentialism, and some of the ways the hypothesis and its related findings have been discussed, extended, and applied in philosophical research.},

  abstract = {Objective Sotos syndrome is a genetic syndrome that has neuroimaging anomalies including large ventricles, increased extracerebral fluid, and midline abnormalities.1 Other findings implicate hypoperfusion of frontal brain areas.2 The current report compares the neuropsychological profiles of fraternal twins discordant for Sotos syndrome. Method A neuropsychological evaluation of the 7-year-old, second grade, affected proband (twin A) was compared with a similar evaluation performed upon his brother (twin B). Results Twin A’s (Sotos) neuropsychological profile was characterized by impaired spatial reasoning and working memory, as compared with relatively more preserved verbal and nonverbal reasoning skills. Performance on overlearned and concrete information was superior to novel conceptual learning and global (as opposed to local) information processing. Mathematics problem solving was more impaired than early reading skills. Frontal/executive functions were significantly impaired. Adaptive behavioral skill development was less impaired, falling in the low average range overall. Comparison of twins A and B documented significant differences in all areas except fine motor speed, with largest differences observed in dorsal stream visuospatial/constructional functions and working memory. Social perception and complex fine motor coordination were impaired in proband but not brother. Discussion/Conclusion The current findings are consistent with previous reports that Sotos syndrome may present with evidence of a mixed right hemisphere learning disability and a profile of executive function impairments. These findings point to the necessity of evaluating individuals with Sotos syndrome at a neuropsychological level, as reliance upon more global intelligence test scores inadequately describes their abilities.},

  abstract = {Perception of emotion in the face is a key component of human social cognition and is considered vital for many domains of life; however, little is known about how this ability differs across the lifespan for men and women. We addressed this question with a large community sample (N = 100,257) of persons ranging from younger than 15 to older than 60 years of age. Participants were viewers of the television show “Tout le Monde Joue”, and the task was presented on television, with participants responding via their mobile devices. Applying latent variable modeling, and establishing measurement invariance between males and females and across age, we found that, for both males and females, emotion perception abilities peak between the ages of 15 and 30, with poorer performance by younger adults and declining performance after the age of 30. In addition, we show a consistent advantage by females across the lifespan, which decreases in magnitude with increasing age. This large scale study with a wide range of people and testing environments suggests these effects are largely robust. Implications are discussed.},

We investigated this phenomenon with a sample of 3,534 high school students who took a background-knowledge test before working on a reading-comprehension test on the topic of ecology. Broken-line regression revealed a knowledge threshold: Below the threshold, the relationship between comprehension and knowledge was weak (β = 0.18), but above the threshold, a strong and positive relation emerged (β = 0.81). Further analyses indicated that certain topically relevant words (e.g., ecosystem, habitat) were more important to know than others when predicting the threshold, and these keywords could be identified using natural-language-processing techniques. Collectively, these results may help identify who is likely to have a problem comprehending information on a specific topic and, to some extent, what knowledge is likely required to comprehend information on that topic.},

Three hundred twenty university students from Canada (n = 115), China (n = 110), and Cyprus (n = 95) were assessed on an adaptation of the Das-Naglieri Cognitive Assessment System (D-N CAS; ). Three alternative models were contrasted: a distinct abilities processing speed model (Model 1) that is dictated by the latent four cognitive factors of planning, attention, simultaneous and successive (PASS) processing, a unitary ability processing speed model (Model 2) that is dictated by the response time nature of all measures, and a bifactor model (Model 3) which included the latent scores of Models 1 and 2 and served as the full model. Results of structural equation modeling showed that (a) the model representing processing speed as a collection of four cognitive processes rather than a unitary processing speed factor was the most parsimonious, and (b) the loadings of the obtained factors were invariant across the three cultural groups. These findings enhance our understanding of the nature of speed of processing across diverse cultures and suggest that even when cognitive processes (i.e., PASS) are operationalized with response time measures, the processing component dominates speed.},

The average number of pathological answers for the various mental diseases ranged from 6 in Huntington's chorea to 48.6 in epileptic psychosis. The average number of pathological answers given for 50 female patients was 19.92; for 50 male patients it was 19.34. As a result of the study of the reactions of 100 male and female patients, five major weaknesses or faults of the inventory were noted. These were complex terminology, too lengthy a list of questions, too many questions having no bearing upon the diagnosis of emotional instability, arbitrary masculine form of test, duplication of content. The revision by the author was made to eliminate the five faults. It has been used in several psychological clinics and standardization on it is in progress.

This has not yet been considered in children and adolescents, where the focus has been on externalising and internalising dimensions.                                         Aims               To examine the existence, correlates and predictive value of a general psychopathology dimension in young people.                                         Method                                Alternative factor models were estimated using self-reports of symptoms in a large community-based sample aged 11–13.5 years (                 N                 = 23 477), and resulting dimensions were assessed in terms of associations with external correlates and future functioning.                                                        Results               Both a traditional two-factor model and a bi-factor model with a general psychopathology bi-factor fitted the data well. The general psychopathology bi-factor best predicted future psychopathology and academic attainment. Associations with correlates and factor loadings are discussed.                                         Conclusions               A general psychopathology factor, which is equal across genders, can be identified in young people. Its associations with correlates and future functioning indicate that investigating this factor can increase our understanding of the aetiology, risk and correlates of psychopathology.},

Participants were 189 students aged 14—15 years, who were considering either academic or applied learning pathways and subject choices for the final 3 years of secondary school. Using Holland’s interest model within a social cognitive career theory (SCCT) framework, logistic regression analyses indicated that all three constructs were significant predictors of pathway and subject selection and enrolment. The best predictive model for students with strong Realistic interests was an interaction of self-efficacy and interest. For Investigative students, both self-efficacy and achievement were best predictors and for Artistic, Social, and Conventional, achievement was the best predictor of future course enrolment. The results of this research offer partial support for the theory of Lent, Brown, and Hackett in that a variable pattern of associations between vocational interest, self-efficacy, and achievement emerged across the Holland interest themes.},

  abstract = {Down syndrome (DS) is caused by trisomy of all or part of human chromosome 21 (HSA21) and is the most common genetic cause of significant intellectual disability. In addition to intellectual disability, many other health problems, such as congenital heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, leukemia, hypotonia, motor disorders, and various physical anomalies occur at an elevated frequency in people with DS. On the other hand, people with DS seem to be at a decreased risk of certain cancers and perhaps of atherosclerosis. There is wide variability in the phenotypes associated with DS. Although ultimately the phenotypes of DS must be due to trisomy of HSA21, the genetic mechanisms by which the phenotypes arise are not understood. The recent recognition that there are many genetically active elements that do not encode proteins makes the situation more complex. Additional complexity may exist due to possible epigenetic changes that may act differently in DS. Numerous mouse models with features reminiscent of those seen in individuals with DS have been produced and studied in some depth, and these have added considerable insight into possible genetic mechanisms behind some of the phenotypes. These mouse models allow experimental approaches, including attempts at therapy, that are not possible in humans. Progress in understanding the genetic mechanisms by which trisomy of HSA21 leads to DS is the subject of this review.}

  abstract = {With the exception of a recently published study and the analyses provided in the test manual, structural validity is mostly uninvestigated for the German version of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Fifth Edition (WISC-V). Therefore, the main aim of the present study was to examine the latent structure of the 10 WISC-V primary subtests on a bifurcated extended population-representative German standardization sample (               N               =1,646) by conducting both exploratory (EFA;               n               =823) and confirmatory (CFA;               n               =823) factor analyses on the original data. Since no more than one salient subtest loading could be found on the               Fluid Reasoning               (FR) factor in EFA, results indicated a four-factor rather than a five-factor model solution when the extraction of more than two suggested factors was forced. Likewise, a bifactor model with four group factors was found to be slightly superior in CFA. Variance estimation from both EFA and CFA revealed that the general factor dominantly accounted for most of the subtest variance and construct reliability estimates further supported interpretability of the               Full Scale Intelligence Quotient               (FSIQ). In both EFA and CFA, most group factors explained rather small proportions of common subtest variance and produced low construct replicability estimates, suggesting that the WISC-V primary indexes were of lower interpretive value and should be evaluated with caution. Clinical interpretation should thus be primarily based on the FSIQ and include a comprehensive analysis of the cognitive profile derived from the WISC-V primary indexes rather than analyses of each single primary index.}

  abstract = {There are few branches of the Theory of Evolution which appear to the mathematical statistician so much in need of exact treatment as those of Regression, Heredity, and Panmixia. Round the notion of panmixia much obscurity has accumulated, owing to the want of precise definition and quantitative measurement. The problems of regression and heredity have been dealt with by Mr. Francis Galton in his epochmaking work on ‘Natural Inheritance,’ but, although he has shown exact methods of dealing, both experimentally and mathematically, with the problems of inheritance, it does not appear that mathematicians have hitherto developed his treatment, or that biologists and medical men have yet fully appreciated that he has really shown how many of the problems which perplex them may receive at any rate a partial answer. A considerable portion of the present memoir will be devoted to the expansion and fuller development of Mr. Galton’s ideas, particularly their application to the problem of bi-parental inheritance. At the same time I shall endeavour to point out how the results apply to some current biological and medical problems. In the first place, we must definitely free our minds, in the present state of our knowledge of the mechanism of inheritance and reproduction, of any hope of reaching a mathematical relation expressing the degree of correlation between individual parent and individual offspring. The causes in any individual case of inheritance are far too complex to admit of exact treatment; and up to the present the classification of the circumstances under which greater or less degrees of correlation between special groups of parents and offspring may be expected has made but little progress. This is largely owing to a certain prevalence of almost metaphysical speculation as to the causes of heredity, which has usurped the place of that careful collection and elaborate experiment by which alone sufficient data might have been accumulated, with a view to ultimately narrowing and specialising the circumstances under which correlation was measured. We must proceed from inheritance in the mass to inheritance in narrower and narrwoer classes, rather than attempt to build up general rules on the observation of individual instances. Shortly, we must proceed by the method of statistics, rather than by the consideration of typical cases. It may seem discouraging to the medical practitioner, with the problem before him of inheritance in a particular family, to be told that nothing but averages, means, and probabilities with regard to large classes can as yet be scientifically dealt with ; but the very nature of the distribution of variation, whether healthy or morhid, seems to indicate that we are dealing with that sphere of indefinitely numerous small causes, which in so many other instances has shown itself only amenable to the calculus of chance, and not to any analysis of the individual instance. On the other hand, the mathematical theory wall be of assistance to the medical man by answering, inter alia, in its discussion of regression the problem as to the average effect upon the offspring of given degrees of morbid variation in the parents. It may enable the physician, in many cases, to state a belief based on a high degree of probability, if it offers no ground for dogma in individual cases. One of the most noteworthy results of Mr. Francis Galton’s researches is his discovery of the mode in which a population actually reproduces itself by regression and fraternal variation. It is with some expansion and fuller mathematical treatment of these ideas that this memoir commences.}

  abstract = {The science of reading emphasizes explicit skills-based reading instruction to support students’ reading acquisition. Yet, despite ample evidence of support, some students do not respond to such instruction adequately. To characterize why some students are not responsive to evidence-based reading instruction and to inform the development of novel instructional approaches for improving responsiveness, cross-disciplinary perspectives on cognitive and academic development are important. Based on the cognitive–academic bidirectional theory, on cognitive training transfer theory, and on various working memory–reading models, the authors propose a cognitive element model of reading instruction that provides a novel framework for considering how to embed supports for cognitive processes within evidence-based reading instruction. Specifically, the element model emphasizes building reading fluency and comprehension/knowledge with explicit instruction. Working memory should not be considered a domain-general construct in working memory training that aims to produce far-transfer effects on reading outcomes. Instead of looking for far-transfer effects, we should make outcomes (i.e., reading) near-transfer tasks such that working memory training should be domain (material) specific, task paradigm specific, and strategy specific and assimilated within existing skill-based reading activities. The authors review intervention studies with rigorous methodology and show promising effects of this framework. With the element model, the authors provide a foundation for considering how one can use extant knowledge of evidence-based reading instruction together with knowledge of related skills in other domains (e.g., cognitive psychology) to maximize the efficacy of reading instruction for all students.},

  abstract = {This study explored the developmental trajectories and predictors of word reading and reading comprehension among young at-risk readers. In fall of first grade, 185 students identified as at-risk for reading difficulties were assessed on measures of domain-specific skills (phonological awareness, letter knowledge, and vocabulary), domain-general skills (working memory, nonverbal reasoning, and processing speed), and word reading and reading comprehension. Word reading and reading comprehension were assessed again in spring of grades 1–4. Individual growth curve modeling showed that the children demonstrated decelerated growth on word reading and linear growth on reading comprehension, although their performance on both word reading and reading comprehension were consistently below average on national norms. After controlling for word reading and reading comprehension in first grade, letter knowledge predicted growth in word reading; vocabulary and nonverbal reasoning predicted growth in reading comprehension. That is, we found different developmental trajectories and different predictors for word reading and reading comprehension among our at-risk sample. Implications are discussed for theory and early reading instruction for at-risk children.},

  abstract = {Based on 378 studies, 541 independent samples, and over 34,000 participants, the current meta-analysis aimed to explore the associations between cognition and reading difficulties (RD). Results showed that compared with age-matched typically developing (TD) peers, RD showed deficits across processing speed, short-term memory, attention, working memory, inhibition, switching, visuospatial skills, and updating (g = −0.72 to −0.48), with more individual differences in inhibition, processing speed, switching, attention, visuospatial skills, and short-term memory (The natural logarithm of ratio of standard deviations [SDR] = .03–.17). The cognitive deficits among those with RD were more severe with age, with lower reading and intelligence (IQ) scores, and with verbal cognitive tasks. Individual differences in cognitive skills among those with RD were larger with age, with comprehensive/nonverbal IQ identification, and with reading comprehension identification. Comorbidity did not affect the cognitive profile of RD strongly. Meta-analytic structural equation modeling showed phonological processing and language comprehension explained over 70\% of the variance between RD and TD across cognitive skills, yet executive function and visuospatial skills contributed uniquely to RD. These findings highlight a domain-specific cognitive path to RD. That is, cognitive deficits may lead to insufficient language development, causing RD indirectly. However, the association between cognitive deficits and RD is not unidirectional or static. Across development, insufficient accumulation of language skills among those with RD also affects cognitive development, especially in the verbal domain. Without high-quality and sustained instruction, such reciprocal associations between cognitive deficits and RD, forming a vicious circle, may be one major reason for persistent reading struggles among individuals with RD.

  abstract = {Despite historical emphasis on “specific” learning disabilities (SLDs), academic skills are strongly correlated across the curriculum. Thus, one can ask how specific SLDs truly are. To answer this question, we used bifactor models to identify variance shared across academic domains (academic g), as well as variance unique to reading, mathematics, and writing. Participants included 686 children aged 8 to 16. Although the sample was overselected for learning disabilities, we intentionally included children across the full range of individual differences in this study in response to growing recognition that a dimensional, quantitative view of SLD is more accurate than a categorical view. Confirmatory factor analysis identified five academic domains (basic reading, reading comprehension, basic math, math problem-solving, and written expression); spelling clustered with basic reading and not writing. In the bifactor model, all measures loaded significantly on academic g. Basic reading and mathematics maintained variance distinct from academic g, consistent with the notion of SLDs in these domains. Writing did not maintain specific variance apart from academic g, and evidence for reading comprehension-specific variance was mixed. Academic g was strongly correlated with cognitive g (r = .72) but not identical to it. Implications for SLD diagnosis are discussed.},

  abstract = {Brain size and IQ are positively correlated. However, multiple meta-analyses have led to considerable differences in summary effect estimations, thus failing to provide a plausible effect estimate. Here we aim at resolving this issue by providing the largest meta-analysis and systematic review so far of the brain volume and IQ association (86 studies; 454 effect sizes from               k               = 194 independent samples;               N               = 26 000+) in three cognitive ability domains (full-scale, verbal, performance IQ). By means of competing meta-analytical approaches as well as combinatorial and specification curve analyses, we show that most reasonable estimates for the brain size and IQ link yield               r               -values in the mid-0.20s, with the most extreme specifications yielding               r               s of 0.10 and 0.37. Summary effects appeared to be somewhat inflated due to selective reporting, and cross-temporally decreasing effect sizes indicated a confounding decline effect, with three quarters of the summary effect estimations according to any reasonable specification not exceeding               r               = 0.26, thus contrasting effect sizes were observed in some prior related, but individual, meta-analytical specifications. Brain size and IQ associations yielded               r               = 0.24, with the strongest effects observed for more               g               -loaded tests and in healthy samples that generalize across participant sex and age bands.},

  abstract = {The Flynn effect (rising intelligence test performance in the general population over time and generations) varies enigmatically across countries and intelligence domains; its substantive meaning and causes remain elusive. This first formal meta-analysis on the topic revealed worldwide IQ gains across more than one century (1909–2013), based on 271 independent samples, totaling almost 4 million participants, from 31 countries. Key findings include that IQ gains vary according to domain (estimated 0.41, 0.30, 0.28, and 0.21 IQ points annually for fluid, spatial, full-scale, and crystallized IQ test performance, respectively), are stronger for adults than children, and have decreased in more recent decades. Altogether, these findings narrow down proposed theories and candidate factors presumably accounting for the Flynn effect. Factors associated with life history speed seem mainly responsible for the Flynn effect’s general trajectory, whereas favorable social multiplier effects and effects related to economic prosperity appear to be responsible for observed differences of the Flynn effect across intelligence domains.},

Participants were 250 children in 107 classrooms in 23 schools pretested on mathematics and general cognitive measures and posttested on mathematics measures. We randomly assigned classrooms to calculation intervention, word-problem intervention, or business-as-usual control. Intervention lasted 17 weeks. Path analyses indicated that scores on working memory and language comprehension assessments moderated responsiveness to calculation intervention. No moderators were identified for responsiveness to word-problem intervention. Across both intervention groups and the control group, attentive behavior predicted both outcomes. Initial calculation skill predicted the calculation outcome, and initial language comprehension predicted word-problem outcomes. These results indicate that screening for calculation intervention should include a focus on working memory, language comprehension, attentive behavior, and calculations. Screening for word-problem intervention should focus on attentive behavior and word problems.},

  abstract = {Abstract           Most research on individual differences in performance on tests of cognitive ability focuses on general cognitive ability (g), the highest level in the three-level Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) hierarchical model of intelligence. About 50\% of the variance of g is due to inherited DNA differences (heritability) which increases across development. Much less is known about the genetics of the middle level of the CHC model, which includes 16 broad factors such as fluid reasoning, processing speed, and quantitative knowledge. We provide a meta-analytic review of 863,041 monozygotic-dizygotic twin comparisons from 80 publications for these middle-level factors, which we refer to as specific cognitive abilities (SCA). Twin comparisons were available for 11 of the 16 CHC domains. The average heritability across all SCA is 55\%, similar to the heritability of g. However, there is substantial differential heritability and the SCA do not show the dramatic developmental increase in heritability seen for g. We also investigated SCA independent of g (g-corrected SCA, which we refer to as SCA.g). A surprising finding is that SCA.g remain substantially heritable (53\% on average), even though 25\% of the variance of SCA that covaries with g has been removed. Our review frames expectations for genomic research that will use polygenic scores to predict SCA and SCA.g. Genome-wide association studies of SCA.g are needed to create polygenic scores that can predict SCA profiles of cognitive abilities and disabilities independent of g. These could be used to foster children’s cognitive strengths and minimise their weaknesses.},

  abstract = {SCIENTIFIC  The use of improvised explosive devices, rocket-propelled grenades, and landmines in recent wars has raised awareness into the effects of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In this study, 893 active duty military personnel were administered a comprehensive evaluation that included extensive premorbid functioning e.g., Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB), structured interview, as well as psychological and neuropsychological testing postdeployment. In this first publication on this dataset, we first present the approach taken to obtain, record, clean, and analyze the data. Over 1 million data points are presented in a descriptive fashion to provide an initial overview of the information obtained by grouping individuals into four groups: (a) blast only; (b) PTSD only; (c) comorbid blast and PTSD; and (d) neither blast nor PTSD. Findings using this dataset have the potential to meaningfully add to the understanding of deployment-related mTBI and PTSD. The robustness of a demographically and psychometrically extensive dataset is discussed, as well as the inclusion of blast and PTSD groups and the value of premorbid data.

  abstract = {Abstract                            Introduction               Birth parameters have long been reported to have a role in human intelligence. However, the causalities reported in previous observational studies were controversial. Our study aims to provide an unbiased investigation of the causal associations between birth parameters and human intelligence using the Mendelian randomization (MR) approach.                                         Methods                                Genetic instrumental variables for MR analyses were extracted from large genome‐wide association studies of infant head circumference (                 N                 ~=~10,768), birth length (                 N                 ~=~28,489), and birth weight (                 N                 ~=~321,223). Data for intelligence were obtained from a meta‐analysis of genome‐wide association studies of 269,867 individuals of the European ancestry. Primary MR analysis was performed using the standard inverse‐variance weighted method, and sensitivity analyses were performed using the weighted median, MR‐Egger, and MR‐PRESSO methods.                                                        Results                                Using 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms as instrumental variables, we found that 1 standard deviation increase in infant head circumference was associated with 0.14‐fold higher scores in intelligence tests (β~=~0.14, 95\% confidence interval: 0.09 to 0.18, P                 IVW                 =2.05~×~10                 –9                 ). The causal relationship was robust when sensitivity analyses were performed. However, birth length and birth weight had no significant associations with intelligence.                                                        Conclusion               Our findings suggested infant head circumference, but not birth weight and length were associated with intelligence, which might indicate that brain development rather than general fetal growth was responsible for the development of intelligence.},

The items of the scale are symptoms associated with depression which have been used in previously validated longer scales. The new scale was tested in household interview surveys and in psychiatric settings. It was found to have very high internal consistency and adequate test- retest repeatability. Validity was established by pat terns of correlations with other self-report measures, by correlations with clinical ratings of depression, and by relationships with other variables which support its construct validity. Reliability, validity, and factor structure were similar across a wide variety of demographic characteristics in the general population samples tested.

The first step in identifying and treating OCD is a thorough evidence-based assessment. This paper reviews the administration pragmatics, psychometric properties, and limitations of commonly used assessment measures for adults and youths with OCD. This includes diagnostic interviews, clinician-administered symptom severity scales, self-report measures, and parent/child measures. Additionally, adjunctive measures that assess important related factors (ie, impairment, family accommodation, and insight) are also discussed. This paper concludes with recommendations for an evidence-based assessment based on individualized assessment goals that include generating an OCD diagnosis, determining symptom severity, and monitoring treatment progress.},

Method:               Seven databases were systematically searched, and 1,643 unique manuscripts were reviewed for inclusion. Data were extracted from 138 included manuscripts to evaluate the use of phonemic awareness instruction with children suspected of having a reading disability. A random effects model was then used to conduct a meta-analysis of these data with regard to child outcomes.                                         Results:                                Gains in this population associated with phonemic awareness instruction can vary as a function of the outcome being used. On average, phonemic awareness instruction had a medium effect on composite (                 g                 = 0.511) and segmentation (                 g                 = 0.571) outcomes and a small effect on outcomes measuring blending (                 g                 = 0.341), first sound identification (                 g                 = 0.428), and deletion (                 g                 = 0.248). Instruction effects were strongest in kindergarten and first grade, but positive outcomes were also found for older children. There was not a significant relationship between cumulative intervention intensity and child performance.                                                        Conclusions:               The present meta-analysis confirms that phonemic awareness instruction can be effective with children of varying ages and that significant gains can be observed on the key outcome measures of segmentation and blending. Graphemes should be incorporated into phonemic awareness instruction, and future studies need to provide information on dosage beyond just the length and frequency of sessions to clarify which aspects of these interventions are most efficient.

It was hypothesized that dynamic testing with graduated prompting and trial-by-trial-assessment could reveal the development of children’s strategy use while tested. The participants were indigenous Dutch and ethnic minority children. Trial-by-trial-testing provided information of how strategy use developed during training. Experimental-group children showed significant changes towards more advanced strategies. Ethnic minority children showed most strategy changes during training, initially needing more prompting but progressively requiring less. The study provided insight into strategy use during and after training. Pretest strategy level was found to be the first predictor of posttest strategy level, followed by condition and ethnicity. Age, gender, and intelligence test scores did not change this order. The relatively short dynamic intervention provides insights into children’s strategy use and their response to prompting, particularly for ethnic minority children.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this research was to test the consistency in measurement of Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fifth Edition (WISC-V; Wechsler, 2014) constructs across the 6 through 16 age span and to understand the constructs measured by the WISC-V. First-order, higher-order, and bifactor confirmatory factor models were used. Results were compared with two recent studies using higher-order and bifactor exploratory factor analysis (Canivez, Watkins, \& Dombrowski, 2015; Dombrowski, Canivez, Watkins, \& Beaujean, 2015) and two using confirmatory factor analysis (Canivez, Watkins, \& Dombrowski, 2016; Chen, Zhang, Raiford, Zhu, \& Weiss, 2015). We found evidence of age-invariance for the constructs measured by the WISC-V. Further, both g and five distinct broad abilities (Verbal Comprehension, Visual Spatial Ability, Fluid Reasoning, Working Memory, and Processing Speed) were needed to explain the covariances among WISC-V subtests, although Fluid Reasoning was nearly equivalent to g. These findings were consistent whether a higher-order or a bifactor hierarchical model was used, but they were somewhat inconsistent with factor analyses from the prior studies. We found a correlation between Fluid Reasoning and Visual Spatial factors beyond a general factor (g) and that Arithmetic was primarily a direct indicator of g. Composite scores from the WISC-V correlated well with their corresponding underlying factors. For those concerned about the fewer numbers of subtests in the Full Scale IQ, the model implied relation between g and the FSIQ was very strong.},

Among young adolescents in the top 1\% of quantitative reasoning ability, individual differences in general cognitive ability level and in specific cognitive ability pattern (that is, the relationships among an individual’s math, verbal, and spatial abilities) lead to differences in educational, occupational, and creative outcomes decades later. Whereas ability level predicts the level of achievement, ability pattern predicts the realm of achievement. Adding information on vocational interests refines prediction of educational and career choices. Finally, lifestyle preferences relevant to career choice, performance, and persistence often change between ages 25 and 35. This change results in sex differences in preferences, which likely have relevance for understanding the underrepresentation of women in careers that demand more than full-time (40 hours per week) commitment.},

In terms of mean-level change, people show increased self-confidence, warmth, self-control, and emotional stability with age. These changes predominate in young adulthood (age 20–40). Moreover, mean-level change in personality traits occurs in middle and old age, showing that personality traits can change at any age. In terms of individual differences in personality change, people demonstrate unique patterns of development at all stages of the life course, and these patterns appear to be the result of specific life experiences that pertain to a person's stage of life.},

This approach, first posited in 2008, has grown substantially over the past decade and is now a full-fledged area of psychiatric research. In this article, we provide an overview and critical analysis of 363 articles produced in the first decade of this research program, with a focus on key theoretical, methodological, and empirical contributions. In addition, we turn our attention to the next decade of the network approach and propose critical avenues for future research in each of these domains. We argue that this program of research will be best served by working toward two overarching aims: (a) the identification of robust empirical phenomena and (b) the development of formal theories that can explain those phenomena. We recommend specific steps forward within this broad framework and argue that these steps are necessary if the network approach is to develop into a progressive program of research capable of producing a cumulative body of knowledge about how specific mental disorders operate as causal systems.},

Methods               We explored the joint factor structure of 11 psychiatric disorders, five personality-disorder trait domains (DSM-5 Section III), and five normative personality trait domains (the ‘Big Five’) in a population-based sample of 2796 Norwegian twins, aged 19‒46.                                         Results               Three factors could be interpreted: (i) a general risk factor for all psychopathology, (ii) a risk factor specific to internalizing disorders and traits, and (iii) a risk factor specific to externalizing disorders and traits. Heritability estimates for the three risk factor scores were 48\% (95\% CI 41‒54\%), 35\% (CI 28‒42\%), and 37\% (CI 31‒44\%), respectively. All 11 disorders had uniform loadings on the general factor (congruence coefficient of 0.991 with uniformity). Ignoring sign and excluding the openness trait, this uniformity of factor loadings held for all the personality trait domains and all disorders (congruence 0.983).                                         Conclusions               Based on our findings, future research should investigate joint etiologic and transdiagnostic models for normative and pathological personality and other psychopathology.},

Student achievement was higher in classrooms of teachers who had more contact with their coaches and in classrooms of teachers with greater confidence in the effectiveness of education. Teachers who relied on school administrators reported less involvement with their coaches and these teachers obtained lower student achievement. There was no interaction between efficacy and coaching, possibly because there was virtually no peer observation. /// Cette recherche porte sur les relations entre le rendement scolaire (connaissance et aptitude cognitive), l'efficacité des enseignants (Gibson et Dembo, 1984) et les interactions avec des aidants (mesures d'auto-évaluation) dans un échantillon de 18 enseignants d'histoire dans 36 classes de 7e et 8e année où était implantée une innovation avec l'intervention de six aidants. Le rendement scolaire a été supérieur dans les classes des enseignants qui avaient plus de contacts avec leurs aidants et dans celles des enseignants ayant une plus grande confiance dans l'efficacité de l'éducation. Les enseignants qui comptaient sur les administrateurs scolaires ont fait état de contacts moins nombreux avec leurs aidants et ont obtenu un rendement scolaire inférieur. Il n'y avait aucune interaction entre l'efficacité et l'encadrement des aidants, peut-être parce qu'il n'y avait presque aucune observation mutuelle.}

The review indicates most Courts will not accept training success as a valid criterion for test selection, although tests for minimum standards might be validated against training alone; Courts generally review equal treatment factors rather than determining the business necessity of training; and finally, there are definite guidelines for demonstrating pay differentials based on training programs.

  abstract = {Doctors always seek to base their decisions on the best available evidence. Often this evidence represents extrapolations of pathophysiological principles and logic rather than established facts based on data derived from patients. The advent and proliferation of randomized controlled trials have led to a rapid increase in the quantity and quality of clinically valid evidence concerning clinical history taking and physical examination, issues of diagnosis, prognosis, therapy and other important health care issues. As a result, it is becoming possible to make explicit much of the implicit non-verbal reasoning of expert clinicians, making their clinical reasoning more comprehensible and accessible to trainees. The ability to track down, critically appraise and incorporate evidence into clinical practice has been named ‘evidence-based medicine’. As the quantity of valid evidence increases so does the requirement for each of us to develop the skills necessary to assimilate, evaluate and make best use of that evidence for patients. Often we fail to identify or address our daily needs for clinically important knowledge, and this may lead to a progressive decline in our clinical competency. When we do seek knowledge, traditional sources of information such as journals and textbooks are often either too disorganized or out of date and we often resort to asking colleagues. The need to maintain and expand clinically important knowledge has been partially addressed by increasing demands for continuing medical education, but how might this be best achieved? Recent evaluations suggest that three evidence-based medicine strategies help fulfil these goals. They include learning evidence-based medicine, seeking and applying evidencebased medical summaries generated by others, and accepting evidence-based protocols developed by others.},

  abstract = {Education has been claimed to reduce aging-associated declines in cognitive function. Given its societal relevance, considerable resources have been devoted to this research. However, because of the difficulty of detecting modest rates of change, findings have been mixed. These discrepancies may stem from methodological shortcomings such as short time spans, few waves, and small samples. The present study overcame these limitations ( N = 1,892, nine waves over a period of 20 years). We tested the effect of education level on baseline performance (intercept) and the rate of change (slope) in crystallized and fluid cognitive abilities ( gc and gf, respectively) in a sample of Japanese adults. Albeit positively related to both intercepts, education had no impact on either the gc or the gf slope. Furthermore, neither intercept exhibited any appreciable correlation with either slope. These results thus suggest that education has no substantial role (direct or mediated) in aging-related changes in cognition.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Neuroticism is associated with the onset and maintenance of a number of mental health conditions, as well as a number of deleterious outcomes (e.g. physical health problems, higher divorce rates, lost productivity, and increased treatment seeking); thus, the consideration of whether this trait can be addressed in treatment is warranted. To date, outcome research has yielded mixed results regarding neuroticism's responsiveness to treatment, perhaps due to the fact that study interventions are typically designed to target disorder symptoms rather than neuroticism itself. The purpose of the current study was to explore whether a course of treatment with the unified protocol (UP), a transdiagnostic intervention that was explicitly developed to target neuroticism, results in greater reductions in neuroticism compared to gold-standard, symptom focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) protocols and a waitlist (WL) control condition.                                         Method                                Patients with principal anxiety disorders (                 N                 = 223) were included in this study. They completed a validated self-report measure of neuroticism, as well as clinician-rated measures of psychological symptoms.                                                        Results                                At week 16, participants in the UP condition exhibited significantly lower levels of neuroticism than participants in the symptom-focused CBT (                 t                 (218)                 = −2.17,                 p                 = 0.03,                 d                 = −0.32) and WL conditions(                 t                 (207)                 = −2.33,                 p                 = 0.02,                 d                 = −0.43), and these group differences remained after controlling for simultaneous fluctuations in depression and anxiety symptoms.                                                        Conclusions               Treatment effects on neuroticism may be most robust when this trait is explicitly targeted.},

In the past century, various formal explanations have been proposed, including the dominant g factor, the revived sampling theory, and the recent multiplier effect model and mutualism model. In this article, we propose a novel idiographic explanation. We formally conceptualize intelligence as evolving networks in which new facts and procedures are wired together during development. The static model, an extension of the Fortuin–Kasteleyn model, provides a parsimonious explanation of the positive manifold and intelligence’s hierarchical factor structure. We show how it can explain the Matthew effect across developmental stages. Finally, we introduce a method for studying growth dynamics. Our truly idiographic approach offers a new view on a century-old construct and ultimately allows the fields of human ability and human learning to coalesce.},

  abstract = {In a recent publication in the Journal of Intelligence, Dennis McFarland mischaracterized previous research using latent variable and psychometric network modeling to investigate the structure of intelligence. Misconceptions presented by McFarland are identified and discussed. We reiterate and clarify the goal of our previous research on network models, which is to improve compatibility between psychological theories and statistical models of intelligence. WAIS-IV data provided by McFarland were reanalyzed using latent variable and psychometric network modeling. The results are consistent with our previous study and show that a latent variable model and a network model both provide an adequate fit to the WAIS-IV. We therefore argue that model preference should be determined by theory compatibility. Theories of intelligence that posit a general mental ability (general intelligence) are compatible with latent variable models. More recent approaches, such as mutualism and process overlap theory, reject the notion of general mental ability and are therefore more compatible with network models, which depict the structure of intelligence as an interconnected network of cognitive processes sampled by a battery of tests. We emphasize the importance of compatibility between theories and models in scientific research on intelligence.},

  abstract = {The positive manifold—the finding that cognitive ability measures demonstrate positive correlations with one another—has led to models of intelligence that include a general cognitive ability or general intelligence (g). This view has been reinforced using factor analysis and reflective, higher-order latent variable models. However, a new theory of intelligence, Process Overlap Theory (POT), posits that g is not a psychological attribute but an index of cognitive abilities that results from an interconnected network of cognitive processes. These competing theories of intelligence are compared using two different statistical modeling techniques: (a) latent variable modeling and (b) psychometric network analysis. Network models display partial correlations between pairs of observed variables that demonstrate direct relationships among observations. Secondary data analysis was conducted using the Hungarian Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Fourth Edition (H-WAIS-IV). The underlying structure of the H-WAIS-IV was first assessed using confirmatory factor analysis assuming a reflective, higher-order model and then reanalyzed using psychometric network analysis. The compatibility (or lack thereof) of these theoretical accounts of intelligence with the data are discussed.},

  abstract = {Current taxonomies of intelligence comprise two factors of mental speed, clerical speed (Gs), and elementary cognitive speed (Gt). Both originated from different research traditions and are conceptualized as dissociable constructs in current taxonomies. However, previous research suggests that tasks of one category can be transferred into the other category by simply changing the mode of administration, i.e., in form of a paper-and-pencil test or in from of a computer-based elementary cognitive task. However, cross-mode correlations for specific tasks are usually only moderate. In the present study, mental speed was assessed as a broad construct across different tasks and stimulus materials. This allowed modeling mental speed as a hierarchical construct for paper-and-pencil as well as for computer-based tests. Cross-mode correlations of the respective general factors were moderate (r = 0.64), while the cross-mode correlations of task-specific components depended on task type (r = 0.12 to r = 0.71). Only the g factors of mental speed, but not the task-specific components, were found to be related with working memory capacity as a marker of cognitive ability. The speed general factor modeled across computer-based tests was more highly correlated with working memory capacity (r = 0.66) than the general factor modeled across paper-and-pencil tests (r = 0.46). These findings corroborate a crucial role of the assessment method and imply that validity of speed tests is affected by the choice of the test format.},

  abstract = {Assessments not only prepare the way for better interventions, but they can also become potent interventions in their own right (Poston \& Hanson, 2010). Instead of waiting until the end of the assessment to begin intervening, the entire assessment process can be made intentionally therapeutic from the start (Finn, 2020; Fischer, 1994). This approach does not require superhuman effort. Transformative assessments are possible when we apply—wherever possible—the same empathic consideration to examinees as we would in a counseling setting. Although this idea sounds simple, there are many aspects of assessment (e.g., report writing) where its application is not at all obvious. In this workshop, we will learn a set of principles designed to help the examinee and others see the presenting problem with new eyes and thus inspire effective efforts to make necessary changes.  Learning Objectives: As a result of this session, attendees will be able to: List the principles of collaborative and therapeutic assessment. Apply a report writing style that recasts the assessment report as a means of communicating an empathic understanding of an examinee. Identify common writing habits that pose unnecessary barriers to comprehension. Utilize assessment feedback into the overall intervention plan.},

Several researchers, however, have reported that the diagnostic accuracy of PSW methods is unacceptably low when strict thresholds were used to identify students with SLDs. We believe these findings give a misleading impression of the magnitude of the diagnostic errors that are likely to arise in PSW assessments. In a simulation study of 10 million cases using a simplified PSW method for demonstration, most of what have been called diagnostic errors were cases in which observed scores and true scores fell on opposite sides of a strict threshold but were still within a buffer zone the size of a typical measurement error. Because small score differences do not result in meaningfully different case conceptualizations, the use of buffer zones reveals that previous estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of PSW methods are misleadingly low. We also demonstrate that diagnostic decisions become increasingly reliable when observed scores are comfortably distant from diagnostic thresholds. For practitioners, we present a flowchart and practical guidelines to improve the accuracy and stability of SLD identification decisions.},

Parents, clinicians, clients, and other readers need more than test-by-test descriptions\&mdash;they need an accessible analysis of the entire situation to determine their next steps. This book provides clear guidance for busy practitioners seeking ways to improve their report writing skills. With a focus on current practice, this new second edition covers DSM-5 updates and the latest assessment instruments including the WJ IV, WISC-V, WAIS-IV, KTEA-3, and the CAS2. New discussion includes advice on tailoring the report to the audience, and annotated case reports provide illustrative models of effective report styles, interpretation, and analysis. Key concepts are highlighted for quick reference throughout, and end-of-chapter questions help reinforce understanding. Reporting styles vary widely within the field, in both content and style; there is no definitive "standard," but many reports fail to reflect best practices and therefore prove less than useful to the reader. This book provides expert guidance throughout the reporting process to help practitioners provide high-quality, accessible reports. Integrate assessment results to provide a person-centered report Identify and navigate critical decision points in the interpretive process Write efficiently yet effectively while enhancing the reader's experience Provide an accurate, informative, and readable assessment report Incorporate practical recommendations to address the referral concerns Expertly-conducted assessments should culminate with a carefully constructed analysis that provides direction via clear communication.

How can one best communicate useful information about CHC abilities in an assessment report and face-to-face meetings?

  abstract = {Whether an ability test delivered on either paper or computer provides the same information is an important question in applied psychometrics. Besides the validity, it is also the fairness of a measure that is at stake if the test medium affects performance. This study provides a comprehensive review of existing equivalence research in the field of reading and listening comprehension in English as a foreign language and specifies factors that are likely to have an impact on equivalence. Taking into account these factors, comprehension measures were developed and tested with N = 442 high school students. Using multigroup confirmatory factor analysis, it is shown that reading and listening comprehension both were measurement invariant across test media. Nevertheless, it is argued that equivalence of data gathered on paper and computer depends on the specific measure or construct, the participants or the recruitment mechanisms, and the software and hardware realizations. Therefore, equivalence research is required for specific instantiations unless generalizable knowledge about factors affecting equivalence is available. Multigroup confirmatory factor analysis is an appropriate and effective tool for the assessment of the comparability of test scores across test media.},

  abstract = {The measurement of science achievement is often unnecessarily restricted to the presentation of reading comprehension items that are sometimes enriched with graphs, tables, and figures. In a newly developed viewing comprehension task, participants watched short videos covering different science topics and were subsequently asked several multiple-choice comprehension questions. Research questions were whether viewing comprehension (1) can be measured adequately, (2) is perfectly collinear with reading comprehension, and (3) can be regarded as a linear function of reasoning and acquired knowledge. High-school students (N = 216) worked on a paper-based reading comprehension task, a viewing comprehension task delivered on handheld devices, a sciences knowledge test, and three fluid intelligence measures. The data show that, first, the new viewing comprehension test worked psychometrically fine; second, performance in both comprehension tasks was essentially perfectly collinear; third, fluid intelligence and domain-specific knowledge fully accounted for the ability to comprehend texts and videos. We conclude that neither test medium (paper-pencil versus handheld device) nor test modality (reading versus viewing) are decisive for comprehension ability in the natural sciences. Fluid intelligence and, even more strongly, domain-specific knowledge turned out to be exhaustive predictors of comprehension performance.},

It is the aim of this article to describe these mental representations and discuss their role in number processing. The authors first review Galton's observations, and then present their own. Finally, they discuss the relevance of these visuo-spatial representations in relation to contemporary debates on number representation and calculation.},

When the patterns were reproduced as wire models, the Zambian children excelled the British. When the patterns were reproduced by drawing, the British children excelled the Zambian. No reliable cross‐cultural differences were found when the patterns were reproduced as plasticine models or as configurations of hand positions. Both cultural groups were equally adversely affected when required to perform the modelling tasks or the hand positions task blind‐folded. The results are interpreted as suggesting that cross‐cultural differences in performance of pattern reproduction tasks reflect different sets of highly specific perceptual skills rather than differences on broader cognitive variables such as practical intelligence, field‐dependency or sensotypes.},

Empirical models using data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods suggest that street efficacy is substantially influenced by various aspects of the social context surrounding adolescents. Adolescents who live in neighborhoods with concentrated disadvantage and low collective efficacy, respectively, are found to have less confidence in their ability to avoid violence after controlling for an extensive set of individual- and family-level factors. Exposure to violence also reduces street efficacy, although it does not explain the association between collective efficacy and individual street efficacy. Adolescents' confidence in their ability to avoid violence is shown to be an important predictor of the types of environments they select for themselves. In particular, adolescents with high levels of street efficacy are less likely to resort to violence themselves or to associate with delinquent peers.},

  abstract = {This article presents a review of cross-cultural influences on Wechsler IQ tests, together with a preliminary investigation into WAIS-III test performance (English administration) for a southern African sample (age range 19–30) stratified for white English first language and black African first language, level and quality of education. (‘African language’ is the term used to denote the indigenous languages of black populations in southern Africa). A two-way ANOVA revealed highly significant effects for both level and quality of education within the black African first language group. Scores for the white English and black African first language groups with advantaged education were comparable with the US standardization, whereas scores for black African first language participants with disadvantaged education were significantly lower than this. Thus indications from this research are that normative studies should take account of the influential variable of quality of education, in addition to level of education. Alternatively faulty conclusions may be drawn about the effects of ethnicity, with the potential for neuropsychological misdiagnosis.},

  abstract = {In 2014, two groups of scientists published open letters on the efficacy of brain-training interventions, or “brain games,” for improving cognition. The first letter, a consensus statement from an international group of more than 70 scientists, claimed that brain games do not provide a scientifically grounded way to improve cognitive functioning or to stave off cognitive decline. Several months later, an international group of 133 scientists and practitioners countered that the literature is replete with demonstrations of the benefits of brain training for a wide variety of cognitive and everyday activities. How could two teams of scientists examine the same literature and come to conflicting “consensus” views about the effectiveness of brain training?             In part, the disagreement might result from different standards used when evaluating the evidence. To date, the field has lacked a comprehensive review of the brain-training literature, one that examines both the quantity and the quality of the evidence according to a well-defined set of best practices. This article provides such a review, focusing exclusively on the use of cognitive tasks or games as a means to enhance performance on other tasks. We specify and justify a set of best practices for such brain-training interventions and then use those standards to evaluate all of the published peer-reviewed intervention studies cited on the websites of leading brain-training companies listed on Cognitive Training Data ( www.cognitivetrainingdata.org ), the site hosting the open letter from brain-training proponents. These citations presumably represent the evidence that best supports the claims of effectiveness.             Based on this examination, we find extensive evidence that brain-training interventions improve performance on the trained tasks, less evidence that such interventions improve performance on closely related tasks, and little evidence that training enhances performance on distantly related tasks or that training improves everyday cognitive performance. We also find that many of the published intervention studies had major shortcomings in design or analysis that preclude definitive conclusions about the efficacy of training, and that none of the cited studies conformed to all of the best practices we identify as essential to drawing clear conclusions about the benefits of brain training for everyday activities. We conclude with detailed recommendations for scientists, funding agencies, and policymakers that, if adopted, would lead to better evidence regarding the efficacy of brain-training interventions.},

  abstract = {A long-standing question in the behavioral sciences is whether cognitive functions can be improved through dedicated training. It is uncontested that training programs can lead to near transfer, meaning increased performance on untrained tasks involving similar cognitive functions. However, whether training also leads to far transfer, meaning increased performance on loosely related untrained tasks or even activities of daily living, is still hotly debated. Here, we review the extant literature and, in particular, the most recent meta-analytic evidence and argue that the ongoing crisis in the field of cognitive-training research may benefit from taking a more mechanistic approach to studying the effectiveness of training. We propose that (a) adopting a more rigorous theoretical framework that builds on a process-based account of training and transfer, (b) considering the role of individual differences in the responsiveness to training, and (c) drawing on Bayesian models of development may help to solve controversial issues in the field and lead the way to designing and implementing more effective training protocols.},

  abstract = {Fifty-four students were tested at specific time intervals over 10 years to determine best native language (NL) predictors of oral and written foreign language (FL) proficiency and FL aptitude. All participants completed two years of Spanish, French, or German. Each was administered measures of NL literacy, oral language, and cognitive ability in elementary school. A measure of FL aptitude was administered at the beginning of ninth grade and FL proficiency was evaluated at the end of the 10th grade. Among the variables, NL literacy measures were the best predictors of FL proficiency, and NL achievement and general (verbal) intelligence were strong predictors of FL aptitude. Results suggest that indices of NL literacy as early as first grade are related to FL proficiency and FL aptitude nine and 10 years later. Findings provide strong support for connections between L1 and L2 skills, and for speculation that “lower level” skills in phonological processing are important for written language development and oral proficiency in a FL.}

This situational predicament, termed stereotype threat, continues to be an intensely debated and researched topic in educational, social, and organizational psychology. In this review, we explore the various sources of stereotype threat, the mechanisms underlying stereotype-threat effects (both mediators and moderators), and the consequences of this situational predicament, as well as the means through which society and stigmatized individuals can overcome the insidious effects of stereotype threat. Ultimately, we hope this review alleviates some of the confusion surrounding stereotype threat while also sparking further research and debate.},

  abstract = {Algebra and geometry are important components of mathematics that are often considered gatekeepers for future success. However, most studies that have researched the cognitive skills required for success in mathematics have only considered the domain of arithmetic. We extended models of mathematical skills to consider how executive function skills play both a direct role in secondary-school-level mathematical achievement as well as an indirect role via algebra and geometry, alongside arithmetic. We found that verbal and visuospatial working memory were indirectly associated with mathematical achievement via number fact knowledge, calculation skills, algebra and geometry. Inhibition was also indirectly associated with mathematical achievement via number fact knowledge and calculation skills. These findings highlight that there are multiple mechanisms by which executive function skills may be involved in mathematics outcomes. Therefore, using specific measures of mathematical processes as well as context-rich assessments of mathematical achievement is important to understand these mechanisms.},

  abstract = {This study tested the hypothesis that learning complex multiplication problems (e.g. 8 × 23 = 184) prior to sleep would benefit recall in adult participants compared with learning the problems prior to a period of wakefulness. This study used a within-participant design where all participants learnt complex multiplication problems in two conditions separated by one week. In one condition, learning was before bed (sleep learning condition) and in the other condition learning was in the morning (wake learning condition). In each condition, recall was tested approximately 10.5 h later. Data were collected online from 77 participants. In the subset of the sample with greater than or equal to 60\% accuracy at the initial learning session (               n               = 37), the sleep learning condition participants had better recall compared with the wake learning condition. This equated to a moderate effect size, Cohen's               d               = 0.51. Regardless of initial levels of learning (               n               = 70) the same beneficial effect of sleep on recall was found with a small effect size, Cohen's               d               = 0.33. This study has identified a beneficial effect of learning prior to sleep on recall of complex multiplication problems compared with learning these problems during the daytime. Future research should explore whether similar effects are observed with children learning simple multiplication facts.},

Abilities captured by the first- and second-stratum factors in the Cattel-Horn-Carroll (CHC) theory have been neglected. The focus has been on a narrow range of cognitive processes that excludes those common to some sensory modalities and a host of new tasks and constructs that have become available through recent conceptual analyses and technological developments. These new areas have emerged from psychology itself (complex problem solving tasks and emotional intelligence) and from disciplines related to psychology like education and economics (economic games and cognitive biases in decision-making).}

Sternberg argues that we are using a fatally-flawed, outdated conception of intelligence; one which may promote technological advancement, but which has also accelerated climate change, pollution, the use of weaponry, and inequality. Instead of focusing on the narrow academic skills measured by standardized tests, societies should teach and assess adaptive intelligence, defined as the use of collective talent in service of the common good. This book describes why the outdated notion of intelligence persists, what adaptive intelligence is, and how it could lead humankind on a more positive path.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses the relationship between culture and intelligence. The main message of the paper is that intelligence cannot fully or even meaningfully be understood outside its cultural context. Behaviour that is considered intelligent in one culture may be considered unintelligent in another culture, and               vice versa               . Moreover, people in different cultures have different implicit (folk) theories of intelligence, so may not even mean the same thing by the word. The relationships between different aspects of intelligence can vary across cultures, with correlations that are positive in one setting proving to be negative in another. The paper opens with a general discussion of issues regarding the relationship between the two concepts. It then describes the theory of successful intelligence, which motivates our work on the interface between culture and intelligence. Finally, the article draws some conclusions.},

Yet, it is not clear that “general intelligence” or g, traditionally conceptualized in terms of a general factor in a psychometrically-based hierarchical model of intelligence, provides an optimal way of defining intelligence as adaptation to the environment. Such a definition of adaptive intelligence would need to be biologically based in terms of evolutionary theory, would need to take into account the cultural context of adaptation, and would need to take into account whether thought and behavior labeled as “adaptively intelligent” actually contributed to the perpetuation of the human and other species, or whether it was indifferent or actually destructive to this perpetuation. In this article, I consider the similarities and differences between “general intelligence” and “adaptive intelligence,” as well as the implications especially of the differences.},

  abstract = {A random sample of members of the National Association of School Psychologists was surveyed to examine the assessment activity of practicing school psychologists. Test-usage estimates and importance ratings for well-established standardized instruments, newly revised or released instruments, and informal procedures such as interview and curriculum-based assessment were examined. Estimates of time involved in various service delivery activities also were obtained. Results indicated that assessment activities still account for about 50\% of the practice hours of school psychologists, followed by consultation (20\%) and treatment (19\%). School psychologists reported frequent use of intellectual, behavior-social-emotional, achievement, and perceptual assessment methods, but were less likely to be involved in vocational or preschool assessment. Familiar instruments, such as the Wechsler scales, the Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-educational Battery-Revised, the Wide Range Achievement Test-Revised, the Bender-Visual Motor Gestalt, the Beery Developmental Test of Motor Integration, and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, were the most used tests. However, in the social-emotional domain, direct assessment methods, such as interview and observation, were more frequently used and rated as more important than standardized measures. These results, and the limitations of the study, are discussed.},

However, because the distributions of the scores in these 2 groups most often overlap, any cut point that is chosen will result in 2 types of errors: false negatives (that is, abnormal cases judged to be normal) and false positives (that is, normal cases placed in the abnormal group). Changing the cut point will alter the numbers of erroneous judgments but will not eliminate the problem. A technique called receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves allows us to determine the ability of a test to discriminate between groups, to choose the optimal cut point, and to compare the performance of 2 or more tests. We discuss how to calculate and compare ROC curves and the factors that must be considered in choosing an optimal cut point.},

Each of these three phenomena is assessed using a longitudinal design spanning 15 years, from when children were 19 months old until they were 16\,years old. Alongside measures for maternal vocabulary, a host of language and (early) reading measures, including vocabulary, early literacy development, oral narrative skill, and reading comprehension, were administered across eight time points to a sample of 58 children. Specific early language and reading skills were generally strongly correlated over time. Reading comprehension at age 12 was predicted by vocabulary at 19 months and emergent literacy at school entry. Vocabulary at 19 months of age predicted early literacy skills prior to school entry and reading comprehension at age 12 years, as did school entry literacy skills. Controlling for maternal and infant vocabulary, children’s oral narrative skill around school entry related uniquely to reading comprehension 10 years later. Findings provide new evidence for the long-term interplay between early language, literacy, and later reading and vocabulary development.},

A total of 71 intervention-control groups were selected ( N = 8,161 at posttest) from studies reporting posttest and follow-up data ( M = 11.17 months) for previously established reading interventions. The posttest effect sizes indicated effects ( dw = 0.37) that decreased to follow-up ( dw = 0.22). Overall, comprehension and phonemic awareness interventions showed good maintenance of effect that transferred to nontargeted skills, whereas phonics and fluency interventions, and those for preschool and kindergarten children, tended not to. Several methodological features also related to effect sizes at follow-up, namely experimental design and dosage, and sample attrition, risk status, and gender balance.},

As an early indicator of Alzheimer's disease, we examined whether olfactory dysfunction could help to distinguish between aMCI/Alzheimer's disease and HAND among PWH.                                         Design:               An observational cohort study.                                         Methods:               Eighty-one older (≥50 years) PWH (83\% men, 65\% white) from the California NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium completed the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT; higher scores{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}better smell identification) and a comprehensive seven-domain neuropsychological test battery and neuromedical evaluation. HAND was classified via Frascati criteria. High aMCI risk was defined as impairment ({$>$}1.0 SD below normative mean) on two of four delayed recall or recognition outcomes (at least one recognition impairment required) from the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised and the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised. We examined UPSIT scores in relation to aMCI risk and HAND status, and continuous memory scores considering adjustments for demographics and relevant clinical or HIV disease characteristics.                                         Results:                                Fifty-seven participants were classified with HAND (70\%) and 35 participants were classified as high aMCI risk (43\%). UPSIT scores were lower (worse) in the high versus low aMCI risk group [                 F                 (1,76){$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}10.04,                 P                 {$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.002], but did not differ by HAND status [                 F                 (1,76){$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.62,                 P                 {$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.43]. UPSIT scores positively correlated with all memory outcomes (                 P                 s{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.05).

  abstract = {Introduction Suicide is a multifaceted event precipitated by underlying biopsychosocial risk factors. Evidence for various psychiatric morbidities underlying suicidality through Psychological Autopsy (PA) is established in case-control studies. However, considering the possible geographical variations and the limited number of studies from developing countries, the estimates of such risk factors across the world could provide great insight into their comparative prevalence and assist in targeting the prevention of suicide. Methods A systematic review of the literature from 1991 to 2020 in the English language was conducted with the protocol registration on PROSPERO ID (CRD 42021249216) to identify the pooled odds ratio of any psychiatric morbidity as a risk factor for suicide. Results Out of 1144 articles, 43 studies were included in this review. The pooled odds ratio for any psychiatric morbidity measured across 31 studies was 16.71 (95\% CI: 12.29 - 22.70, Tau2~=~0.58, I2~=~80.4\%, Cochran's Q~=~153.36, df~=~30, p-value {$<$}0.001). The subgroup analysis for affective disorder, previous suicide attempt, WHO region-wise risk distribution, and publication year of study were not significant. Conclusions There is a sixteen-fold increased risk of suicide in persons with mental disorders compared to healthy controls, and the risk is similar across the geographical region and publication time. The international efforts to reduce the common risk factors for suicide would equally be helpful for all countries despite cultural variations. Early identification and treatment of sleep disorders, physical illnesses, anxiety, and personality disorders should be prioritized along with the established mental disorders to reduce suicide rates across the world.},

  abstract = {Two experiments investigated the effects of strategy knowledge and strategy training on the working memory (WM) performance in children (ages 10—11) with and without reading disabilities (RD). Experiment 1 examined the relationship between strategy knowledge (stability of strategy choices) and WM performance as a function of initial, gain (cued), and maintenance conditions. WM performance was significantly improved for both groups under cued conditions; however, the performances of children with RD were inferior to those of children without RD across all memory conditions. Measures of WM capacity rather than strategy stability or processing efficiency best predicted reading comprehension performance. Experiment 2 assessed the effects of strategy training on WM performance by randomly assigning children to strategy instruction or control conditions. Significant improvements in WM performance occurred as a function of training conditions, but the residual WM differences between the reading groups remained. Although the results showed that stable strategy choices, cued performance, and strategy instruction significantly bolstered WM performance in children with RD, their overall WM performance, however, was constrained by capacity limitations.},

Psychologists, psychiatrists and social workers were asked to supply opinions on the kinds of material which constitute proper content for psychological reports in a psychiatric setting. The findings give some suggestions concerning what members of these professions tend to consider as important topics for clinical evaluation. The data may be further interpreted as a challenge to some of the content commonly found in psychological reports.},

  abstract = {At the heart of every good graph drawing algorithm lies an efficient procedure for assigning canvas positions to a graph’s nodes and the bend points of its edges. However, every real-world implementation of such an algorithm must address numerous problems that have little to do with the actual algorithm, like handling input and output formats, formatting node texts, and styling nodes and edges. We present a new framework, implemented in the Lua programming language and integrated into the TikZ graphics description language, that aims at simplifying the implementation of graph drawing algorithms. Implementers using the framework can focus on the core algorithmic ideas and will automatically profit from the framework’s pre- and post-processing steps as well as from the extensive capabilities of the TikZ graphics language and the \textbackslash TeX\textbackslash TeX\{\textbackslash hbox\{\textbackslash TeX\}\} typesetting engine. Algorithms already implemented using the framework include the Reingold-Tilford tree drawing algorithm, a modular version of Sugiyama’s layered algorithm, and several force-based multilevel algorithms.},

Traditionally, these summary statistics comprise the mean and the standard deviation (SD) of the ratings, and the number of observations. Such summary statistics can preserve the rank order of items, but provide distorted estimates of the relative distances between items because of the ordinal nature of Likert ratings. Inter-item relations in such ordinal scales can be more appropriately modelled by cumulative link mixed effects models (CLMMs). In a series of simulations, and with a reanalysis of an existing rating norms dataset, we show that CLMMs can be used to more accurately norm items, and can provide summary statistics analogous to the traditionally reported means and SDs, but which are disentangled from participants’ response biases. CLMMs can be applied to solve important statistical issues that exist for more traditional analyses of rating norms.},

It is one of the most fundamental concepts in psychological science and is crucial for effective adaption of behavior to varying environmental demands. Changing external task demands have been shown to induce reconfiguration of functional brain networks. However, whether neural reconfiguration between different tasks is associated with intelligence has not yet been investigated. We used fMRI data from 812 subjects to show that higher scores of general intelligence are related to less brain network reconfiguration between resting state and seven different task states as well as to network reconfiguration between tasks. This association holds for all functional brain networks except the motor system, and replicates in two independent samples (             N             = 138,             N             = 184). Our findings suggest that the intrinsic network architecture of individuals with higher intelligence scores is closer to the network architecture as required by various cognitive demands. Multi-task brain network reconfiguration may, therefore, represent a neural reflection of the behavioral positive manifold – the essence of the concept of general intelligence. Finally, our results support neural efficiency theories of cognitive ability and reveal insights into human intelligence as an emergent property from a distributed multi-task brain network.},

One definition of fair use states that a common qualifying score may be used with two groups if the regression line based on one group does not systematically over‐ or under‐predict criterion performance in the other. However, it is shown that when the two groups differ appreciably in mean test score, the above procedure, which is “fair” to individual members of the group scoring lower on the test, is “unfair” to the lower group as a whole in the sense that the proportion qualified on the test will be smaller, relative to the higher‐scoring group, than the proportion that will reach any specified level of criterion performance. An alternate definition would specify that the qualifying scores on a test should be set at levels that will qualify applicants in the two groups in proportion to the fraction of the two groups reaching a specified level of criterion performance.},

However, the developmental part of the                 Gf                 –                 Gc                 theory of intelligence has not gained the same recognition. Results are inconsistent, but recent discussions emphasize the importance of homogeneity of samples with regard to education and language when investigating the developmental Investment theory.                                                        Aims                                The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of                 Gf                 and                 Gc                 on the development of knowledge and skills in a sample of children in compulsory school who are homogenous with regard to level of education, age, and cultural background.                                                        Sample               Totally, 9,002 individuals from the evaluation through follow‐up database born in 1972 and who left compulsory school in 1988 were included. These individuals were followed up in Grades 3, 6, and 9.                                         Methods                                Structural equation modelling was used, and autoregressive path models were fitted. All modelling was performed using                 M                 plus version 6.1.                                                        Results                                In the first step, a path model with a simplex structure was defined.

Studies that fail to demonstrate experimental control may not be published because researchers are unwilling to submit these papers for publication and journals are unlikely to publish negative results (i.e., the file drawer effect). SCRD studies comprise a large proportion of intervention research in special education. Consequently, the existing body of research, comprised mainly of studies that show experimental control, may artificially inflate efficacy of interventions. We discuss how experimental control evolved as the standard for high-quality SCRD; why, in the era of evidence-based practice, rigorous studies that fail to fully demonstrate experimental control are important to include in the body of published intervention research; the role of non-replication studies in discovering intervention boundaries; and considerations for researchers who wish to conduct and appraise studies that fail to yield full experimental control.},

  abstract = {The reported prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has increased dramatically since the 1980s. In response, researchers, educators, and policy makers have sought to develop effective technologies for assessment and intervention. A focus on evidenced-based practices is logical, given significant deficits in language, social interaction, cognition, and adaptive behavior that comprise these conditions. Although critical, a technology of best practices is insufficient without understanding the important role that diversity plays in helping persons with ASD, particularly those with the most severe impairments, to lead fulfilling lives. The aim of the current article is threefold. First, we explore the concept of diversity with particular attention to neurodiversity among persons with ASD. We describe how cultural and linguistic diversity influence identification of students with ASD in special education, with data to suggest that racially diverse students are underrepresented in the autism category. We then examine the educational process with particular focus on the impact of parent and family culture on perception of disability, the influence of diverse family systems on interventions, and the successful interventions for diverse contexts. We conclude with recommendations for culturally competent practice and research.},

Method               Children were given standardized language batteries at kindergarten and at second, fourth, and eighth grades. A revised modified parallel analysis was used to determine the dimensionality of these items at each grade level. A confirmatory factor analysis was also performed on the subtest scores to evaluate alternate models of dimensionality.                                         Results               The revised modified parallel analysis revealed a single dimension across items with evidence of either test specific or language area specific minor dimensions at different ages. The confirmatory factor analysis tested models involving modality (receptive or expressive) and domain (vocabulary or sentence use) against a single-dimension model. The 2-dimensional model involving domains of vocabulary and sentence use fit the data better than the single-dimensional model; however, the single-dimension model also fit the data well in the lower grades.                                         Conclusions               Much of the variance in standardized measures of language appears to be attributable to a single common factor or trait. There is a developmental trend during middle childhood for grammatical abilities and vocabulary abilities to become differentiated. These measures do not provide differential information concerning receptive and expressive abilities.},

  abstract = {Pediatric intelligence tests, such as the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, are commonly used diagnostic tools used in the process of diagnosing learning and behavior disabilities. Decisions concerning treatment are made based on the results of these tests and they are frequently used in educational and vocational contexts for important decisions that impact persons’ academic or professional lives. Research has however shown that important errors may occur despite the application of validation processes and adherence to quality criteria for psychometric tests. At the same time this evidence seems not to be pervasively acknowledged in psychological practice and research. In this article, I will showcase research that places attention on sources of measurement error in pediatric intelligence testing, discuss a process-performance approach to measurement in intelligence testing, and propose the “pretest methods,” methods stemming from the field of survey methodology commonly used in questionnaire construction, as a method to help address the problem of sources of measurement error in pediatric intelligence testing and improve the development of these intelligence tests.},

This review examined a group of studies that addressed outcomes for young children with ASD who started early intervention at a range of ages. The review was selective by including only papers that examined the age of initiation of treatment as well as baseline cognitive, language, or adaptive level and, in addition, employed a method to control for the covariance between early ability level and age of beginning intervention. Fourteen studies were identified and then compared on methods and outcomes. The support for “earlier is better” was mixed, but it was clear that complex relationships among predictor variables need to be explored in order to understand the role of age of starting early intervention for later outcomes.},

Although the Flynn effect is widely accepted, most efforts to estimate it have relied upon “scorecard” approaches that make estimates of its magnitude and error of measurement controversial and prevent determination of factors that moderate the Flynn effect across different IQ tests. We conducted a meta-analysis to determine the magnitude of the Flynn effect with a higher degree of precision, to determine the error of measurement, and to assess the impact of several moderator variables on the mean effect size. Across 285 studies (N = 14,031) since 1951 with administrations of 2 intelligence tests with different normative bases, the meta-analytic mean was 2.31, 95\% CI [1.99, 2.64], standard score points per decade. The mean effect size for 53 comparisons (N = 3,951, excluding 3 atypical studies that inflate the estimates) involving modern (since 1972) Stanford-Binet and Wechsler IQ tests (2.93, 95\% CI [2.3, 3.5], IQ points per decade) was comparable to previous estimates of about 3 points per decade but was not consistent with the hypothesis that the Flynn effect is diminishing. For modern tests, study sample (larger increases for validation research samples vs. test standardization samples) and order of administration explained unique variance in the Flynn effect, but age and ability level were not significant moderators. These results supported previous estimates of the Flynn effect and its robustness across different age groups, measures, samples, and levels of performance.}

We examined the factorial structure and discriminant validity of three measures extracted from the Delis–Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) version of the TOL, namely the D-KEFS Tower Test, in 270 individuals from a publicly available release of the Enhanced Nathan Kline Institute—Rockland sample. Confirmatory factor analyses revealed a multidimensional three-factor solution of the measures extracted from the D-KEFS Tower Test; first-move-time, excess moves, and rule violations. This model was better than the unidimensional model, the two-factor model, the bifactor model and the model that included the total achievement scores. These results support the discriminant validity of the three latent factors, over their distinct relations to the total achievement score. The best fitting model was gender-invariant and age-variant. Overall, the multidimensionality of the measures extracted from the D-KEFS Tower Test reflects the need to use multiple metrics from this version of TOL to capture executive functions instead of a single score.},

People with significant disabilities are not excluded from this principle, but often may be prevented from receiving high-quality and comprehensive instruction necessary for a healthy sexual life. The functional model of self-determination emphasizes increasing knowledge, access to environments, and positive self-perceptions and may be an effective framework for the delivery of sexuality education to people with significant disabilities. We explored ways in which self-determination and sexuality education for people with significant disabilities are aligned. We also conducted a systematic review of sexuality education intervention research for this population and found significant gaps related to self-determined sexuality. Suggestions for sexuality education for persons with significant disabilities as well as barriers are presented and implications for stakeholders and future researchers are discussed.}

Data were compared to determine the effects on alphabetic skills acquisition and maintenance. The effects on student attentive behavior and engagement in problem behavior in each intervention condition also were compared.

This is fundamental to the evidence-based movement, but special education professionals may not recognize and avoid ineffective interventions. This article aims to improve recognition of potentially ineffective interventions by shedding light on aspects of science, pseudoscience, and some mistakes frequently made in evaluating claims of intervention effectiveness. By becoming familiar with the distinctions between science and pseudoscience, and by developing an understanding of how errors in thinking are used to promote and defend interventions unsupported by empirical evidence, special education professionals can better protect their students with disabilities from potential harms associated with ineffective practices.},

Specific attention is then given to replication as it relates to group design and single case experimental design research, two prominent albeit philosophically different empirical methodologies.

While the topic of sexuality has received increased attention in the fields of intellectual and developmental disabilities generally, less consideration has focused on the unique needs of individuals with ASD specifically. This paper presents one position in support of sexuality education for children and adolescents with ASD. The nature of human sexuality is discussed to provide a context for the rights of individuals with ASD to learn about their sexuality. Further justification for providing sexuality education in terms of the unique characteristics of this population is offered in conjunction with potential consequences of failing to provide sexuality education. Lastly, information regarding a decision-making process for sexuality education curriculum is presented, including the responsibilities of families and professionals providing sexuality education.}

  abstract = {Although factor analysis is the most commonly-used method for examining the structure of cognitive variable interrelations, multidimensional scaling (MDS) can provide visual representations highlighting the continuous nature of interrelations among variables. Using data ( N = 8,813; ages 17—97 years) aggregated across 38 separate studies, MDS was applied to 16 cognitive variables representative of five well-established cognitive abilities. Parallel to confirmatory factor analytic solutions, and consistent with past MDS applications, the results for young (18—39 years), middle (40—65 years), and old (66—97 years) adult age groups consistently revealed a two-dimensional radex disk, with variables from fluid reasoning tests located at the center. Using a new method, target measures hypothesized to reflect three aspects of cognitive control ( updating, storage-plus-processing, and executive functioning) were projected onto the radex disk. Parallel to factor analytic results, these variables were also found to be centrally located in the cognitive ability space. The advantages and limitations of the radex representation are discussed.},

Performance on these measures is consistently related to performance in other mathematics domains, but the strength of these relations may be overestimated because general cognitive ability has not been fully controlled in prior studies. The first of two meta‐analyses (162 studies, 33,101 participants) confirmed a relation between performance on whole number (                 r                 = 0.33) and fractions number (                 r                 = 0.41) lines and overall mathematics performance. These relations were generally consistent across content domains (e.g., algebra and computation) and other moderators. The second (71 studies, 14,543 participants) used meta‐analytic structural equation modeling to confirm these relations while controlling general cognitive ability (defined by IQ and working memory measures) and, in one analysis, general mathematics competence. The relation between number line performance and general mathematics competence remained significant but reduced (                 β                 = 0.13). Controlling general cognitive ability, whole number line performance consistently predicted competence with fractions but not performance on numeracy or computations measures. The results suggest an understanding of the magnitudes represented by whole numbers might be particularly important for students’ fractions learning.                                                        Research Highlights                                                                        Two meta‐analyses examined the link between the number line and mathematics performance.                                                           The first revealed significant relations across domains (e.g., algebra and computation).                                                           The second controlled for general cognitive ability and resulted in reduced but still significant relations.                                                           The relation between number line and fractions performance was stronger than relations to other domains.},

  abstract = {The neuropsychological construct of executive functions (EFs), and the psychometric Cattell–Horn–Carroll (CHC) theory of cognitive abilities are both approaches that attempt to describe cognitive functioning. The coherence between EF and CHC abilities has been mainly studied using factor-analytical techniques. Through multivariate regression analysis, the current study now assesses the integration of these latent constructs in clinical assessment. The predictive power of six widely used executive tasks on five CHC measures (crystallized and fluid intelligence, visual processing, short-term memory, and processing speed) is examined. Results indicate that executive tasks—except for the Stroop and the Tower of London—predict overall performance on the intelligence tests. Differentiation in predicting performance between the CHC abilities is limited, due to a high shared variance between these abilities. It is concluded that executive processes such as planning and inhibition have a unique variance that is not well-represented in intelligence tests. Implications for the use of EF tests and operationalization of CHC measures in clinical practice are discussed.},

  abstract = {Recent research has suggested that a range of psychological disorders may stem from a single underlying common factor, which has been dubbed the p-factor. This finding may spur a line of research in psychopathology very similar to the history of factor modeling in intelligence and, more recently, personality research, in which similar general factors have been proposed. We point out some of the risks of modeling and interpreting general factors, derived from the fields of intelligence and personality research. We argue that: (a) factor-analytic resolution, i.e., convergence of the literature on a particular factor structure, should not be expected in the presence of multiple highly similar models; and (b) the true underlying model may not be a factor model at all, because alternative explanations can account for the correlational structure of psychopathology.},

Within the latter, there are, for instance, major disputes over whether intelligence is one thing (a general ability) or multiple things. In our view, it is important to have a clear conception of what intelligence is. In this chapter we adhere to such a conception and present a formal model of psychometric intelligence. This model illuminates mechanisms that can explain some important and well replicated phenomena in the study of intelligence.},

The results showed that the use of the self-instruction program resulted in significant improvement over the general instruction program. Furthermore, far transfer was found for the children with learning disabilities in the experimental group when they used effective problem-solving strategies on nontrained tasks. The results are consistent with previous findings suggesting the importance of self-instruction in mathematics training programs.},

This development has sparked an appreciation for the wider context in which such effect sizes are found because the importance assigned to specific sizes may vary from situation to situation. We add to this development a crucial but in psychology hitherto underappreciated contingency: There are mathematical limits to the magnitudes that population effect sizes can take within the common multivariate context in which psychology is situated, and these limits can be far more restrictive than typically assumed. The implication is that some hypothesized or preregistered effect sizes may be impossible. At the same time, these restrictions offer a way of statistically triangulating the plausible range of unknown effect sizes. We explain the reason for the existence of these limits, illustrate how to identify them, and offer recommendations and tools for improving hypothesized effect sizes by exploiting the broader multivariate context in which they occur.},

My review of person–job and person–organization fit research that used polynomial regression to establish fit effects provides mixed support for the explanatory power of fit. Individuals report most optimal outcomes when there is fit on attributes they rate as highest, and they report lowest outcomes when the environment offers less than they need or desire. Linking these findings to individuals' abilities and opportunities to adapt, I reconsider fit theory and outline options for future research and practice.},

Databases (PubMed, Scopus) and article reference lists were reviewed, identifying 264 studies and including 14 in the review. These include participants between 4 and 15 years of age, with typical development, and they evaluated the structure of WM using confirmatory factor analysis. Results show that from 4 to 6 years onwards a structure composed of a domain-general executive component together with two domain-specific storage components (verbal, visuospatial) is identified, generally being the best fitting model. Limitations and potential contributions of the reported results are discussed.},

  abstract = {Attentional control as an ability to regulate information processing during goal-directed behavior is critical to many theories of human cognition and thought to predict a large range of everyday behaviors. However, in recent years, failures to reliably assess individual differences in attentional control have sparked a debate concerning whether attentional control, as currently conceptualized and assessed, can be regarded as a valid psychometric construct. In this consensus paper, we summarize the current debate from theoretical, methodological, and analytical perspectives. First, we propose a consensus-based definition of attentional control and the cognitive mechanisms that potentially contribute to individual differences in attentional control. Next, guided by the findings of an in-depth literature survey, we discuss the psychometric considerations that are critical when assessing attentional control. We then provide suggestions for recent methodological and analytical approaches that can alleviate the most common concerns. We conclude that, to truly advance our understanding of the construct of attentional control, we must develop a theory-driven and empirically supported consensus on how we define, operationalize, and assess attentional control. This consensus paper presents a first step to achieve this goal; a shift toward transparent reporting, sharing of materials and data, and cross-laboratory efforts will further accelerate progress.}

  abstract = {The DNA revolution made it possible to use DNA to predict intelligence. We argue that this advance will transform intelligence research and society. Our paper has three objectives. First, we review how the DNA revolution has transformed the ability to predict individual differences in intelligence. Thousands of DNA variants have been identified that – aggregated into genome-wide polygenic scores (GPS) – account for more than 10\% of the variance in phenotypic intelligence. The intelligence GPS is now one of the most powerful predictors in the behavioral sciences. Second, we consider the impact of GPS on intelligence research. The intelligence GPS can be added as a genetic predictor of intelligence to any study without the need to assess phenotypic intelligence. This feature will help export intelligence to many new areas of science. Also , the intelligence GPS will help to address complex questions in intelligence research, in particular how the gene-environment interplay affects the development of individual differences in intelligence. Third, we consider the societal impact of the intelligence GPS, focusing on DNA testing at birth, DNA testing before birth (e.g., embryo selection), and DNA testing before conception (e.g., DNA dating). The intelligence GPS represents a major scientific advance, and, like all scientific advances, it can be used for bad as well as good. We stress the need to maximize the considerable benefits and minimize the risks of our new ability to use DNA to predict intelligence.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Little research has examined the association between general figure closure speed, a stratum I ability within the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) model of intelligence, and face-specific closure ability; an important consideration, as some research suggests face processing is independent of other abilities. Additionally, figure closure ability (general and face) may correlate negatively with trait-autism, due to theorised autism-related difficulties in global processing. Therefore, in addition to developing a psychometrically robust short-form Mooney face detection task, we administered the Gestalt Figure Completion Test and the Autism Spectrum Quotient to a sample of 263 general community adults. We found convergent validity between face-specific and general figure closure ability (               r               \,=\,.44, 95\%CI:[.30, .58]). Furthermore, based on a latent variable model, general figure closure ability was directly, and face-specific figure closure ability indirectly, negatively associated with trait-autism (i.e., nonverbal communication). We conclude that face detection ability evidences convergent validity with general figure closure ability and can be measured reliably in less than four minutes. Finally, a general, rather than face-specific, figure closure process may tap more directly into autism-like nonverbal communication ability, supporting the notion that global processing abilities of non-face objects may better reflect the requirements to ‘fill in the gaps’ in social contexts.},

The study also tested the extent executive functioning, verbal working memory, and mental rotation spatial ability predict mathematics achievement. Structural equation modeling was deployed to test the model. The model was derived from prior studies that tested the relationships among subsets of the variables tested in this study. The structural equation model showed a good model fit. Executive functioning significantly predicted both verbal working memory and visuospatial working memory, though the predictive relationship was stronger from executive functioning to visuospatial working memory. These findings are consistent with prior findings and existing theory pertaining to the structure of working memory and the intercorrelations among sub-components of working memory. Finally, the path loading from mental rotation to mathematics achievement was statistically significant and moderate in magnitude, confirming the important implications of mental rotation spatial ability to mathematics achievement.

We define the Flynn effect at the family level, using longitudinal data and two new family-level cohort definitions. Multilevel growth curve analyses of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 data showed that children in families with later-born mothers had higher average PIAT math scores, and lower average reading comprehension scores and growth, in young and middle childhood. Children in families where the first child was born later had higher average PIAT math, reading recognition, and reading comprehension scores, as well as larger developmental growth. The latter family-level Flynn effects were of higher magnitudes than the usual individual-level Flynn effect found in previous studies. Our results, showing family level-intercept and slope Flynn effects for both maternal birthyear and first child birthyear, have implications for research aiming to explain the Flynn effect.},

  abstract = {The differentiation–dedifferentiation hypothesis of general cognitive ability has been widely studied, but comparable research on crystallized intelligence is scarce. To close this gap, we conducted an empirical test of the age differentiation hypothesis of declarative knowledge as proposed in Cattell’s investment theory, which predicts that knowledge differentiates into diverse forms after compulsory education ends. Thereto, a cross-sectional sample of 1,629 participants aged 18–70 years (M = 45.3) completed a comprehensive knowledge test comprising 120 broadly sampled questions from 12 knowledge domains, as well as a measure of openness/intellect. To investigate age-related differences in the level and structure of knowledge, we performed invariance tests in local structural equation models. The results did not provide any evidence for age-related differentiation of declarative knowledge but indicated age-related differences in the mean structure. Higher levels in openness/intellect were associated with higher levels in knowledge but not with more differentiated structure of knowledge. Contrary to predictions of the investment theory, our results suggest that declarative knowledge is age invariant across major parts of the adult lifespan.

  abstract = {We advanced several “riskier tests” of the validity of bifactor models of psychopathology, which included that the general and specific psychopathology factors should be reliable and well represented by their respective indicators and that including a general factor should improve on the correlated factor model’s external validity. We compared bifactor and correlated factors models of psychopathology using data from a community sample of youth ( N = 2,498) whose parents provided ratings on psychopathology and theoretically relevant external criteria (i.e., personality, aggression, antisociality). Bifactor models tended to yield either general or specific factors that were unstable and difficult to interpret. The general factor appeared to reflect a differentially weighted amalgam of psychopathology rather than a liability for psychopathology broadly construed. With rare exceptions, bifactor models did not explain additional variance in first-order psychopathology symptom dimensions or external criteria compared with correlated factors models. Together, our findings call into question the validity of bifactor models of psychopathology and the p factor more broadly.},

  abstract = {Flynn has proposed a grand integrative theory, which he calls “scientific spectacles,” to explain the phenomenon of rising IQ scores across multiple decades known as the Flynn effect (FE). In his theory, he purports that modern society has placed increasing value and emphasis on the application and education of scientific principles—which include abstract fluid reasoning—and this has mirrored larger score increases in the abstract fluid reasoning tasks included as part of most intelligence tests. He highlights huge gains in the Wechsler Similarities subtest over time as one linchpin supporting his theory that fluid reasoning is rising faster than other aspects of intelligence, but further points to large increases in Wechsler performance tasks (i.e., perceptual organization and reasoning) relative to crystallized tasks, and to the many studies of Raven’s Progressive Matrices, which is widely held to be a fairly pure measure of fluid reasoning. As with any new theory of this magnitude, Flynn’s grand proposal has invited numerous criticisms that must now be addressed—and this is as it should be in the spirit of scientific progress. Each of these issues is multilayered and has many legitimate perspectives. The present article attempts to carefully consider each issue and perspective in sequence.}

  abstract = {Many Flynn effect (FE) studies compare scores across different editions of Wechsler’s IQ tests. When construct changes are introduced by the test developers in the new edition, however, the presumed generational effects are difficult to untangle from changes due to test content. To remove this confound, we use the same edition of Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children–Fourth Edition (WISC-IV) across an 11-year period. Whereas previous research has reported the FE to be less than half the theoretical rate when comparing WISC-IV with Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children–Fifth Edition (WISC-V), we find the rate of gain to be nearly identical to Flynn’s prediction when comparing only WISC-IV scores over the same time period. The FE is shown to vary significantly across the domains of cognitive ability, and thus changes to the construct coverage of the WISC-V Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) composite between editions significantly affect FE findings. Implications for future FE research are discussed.}

  abstract = {Flexibility (i.e., the number of categorically different ideas), fluency (i.e., the answer quantity), and originality (i.e., the quality of ideas) are essential aspects of the ability to think divergently. Theoretically, fluency and ideational flexibility tasks are akin to one another. However, flexibility was also considered to be uniquely related to working memory capacity due to the task requirements involved in generating diverse answers (e.g., self-monitoring, suppression, and category generation). Given that the role of working memory is strengthened in flexibility tasks relative to fluency and originality tasks, flexibility should be more strongly related with working memory. Additionally, mental speed should show a similar pattern of results because mental speed has been previously related to task complexity. Based on a sample of N = 409 adults (Mage = 24.01 years), we found in latent variable models that fluency/originality strongly predicts flexibility and accounts for 61\% of its variance. Creative flexibility was unrelated to working memory and mental speed after controlling for fluency/originality. Additionally, the residual of a latent flexibility factor was unrelated to self-reported creative activities. We concluded that flexibility, as measured here, can be deemed primarily a method factor that did not show value over and above fluency/originality as assessed in traditional fluency and originality tasks. We discussed perspectives for disentangling trait and method variance in flexibility tasks.},

This hypothesis predicts a change in the correlation between creativity and intelligence at around 1.33 standard deviations above the population mean. A closer inspection of previous inconclusive results suggests that the heterogeneity is mostly due to the use of suboptimal data analytical procedures. Herein, we applied and compared three methods that allowed us to handle intelligence as a continuous variable. In more detail, we examined the threshold of the creativity-intelligence relation with (a) scatterplots and heteroscedasticity analysis, (b) segmented regression analysis, and (c) local structural equation models in two multivariate studies (N1 = 456; N2 = 438). We found no evidence for the threshold hypothesis of creativity across different analytical procedures in both studies. Given the problematic history of the threshold hypothesis and its unequivocal rejection with appropriate multivariate methods, we recommend the total abandonment of the threshold.},

  abstract = {In this article, we review research literature concerning number sense from several related fields. Whereas other authors have pointed to difficulty defining number sense or to some degree of inconsistency in the literature, we argue instead that this is a case of polysemy: three constructs given the same name. Our purpose is to clarify the research literature concerning number sense by naming and defining these three constructs, identifying similarities and differences among them, categorizing the research traditions associated with each construct, and summarizing the methods used and findings reported. We compare and contrast themes in each body of literature by drawing on a sample of 141 research articles that were focused on number sense. We find evidence that there is confusion of number sense constructs across research traditions. We emphasize the need for clarity in order for research in each of these traditions to progress.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Measurement is fundamental to all research in psychology and should be accorded greater scrutiny than typically occurs. Among other claims, McNeish and Wolf (Thinking twice about sum scores.               Behavior Research Methods               ,               52               , 2287-2305) argued that use of sum scores (a) implies that a highly constrained latent variable model underlies items comprising a scale, and (b) may misrepresent or bias relations with other criteria. The central claim by McNeish and Wolf that use of sum scores requires the assumption that a parallel test model underlies item responses is incorrect and without psychometric merit. Instead, if a set of items is unidimensional, estimators of reliability are available even if the factor model underlying the set of items does not have a highly constrained form. Thus, dimensionality of a set of items is the key issue, and whether strict constraints on parameter estimates do or do not hold dictate the appropriate way to estimate reliability. McNeish and Wolf also claimed that more precise forms of scoring, such as estimating factor scores, would be preferable to sum scores. We provide analytic bases for reliability estimation and then provide several demonstrations of reliability estimation and the relative advantages of sum scores and factor scores. We contend that several claims by McNeish and Wolf are questionable and that, as a result, multiple recommendations they made and conclusions they drew are incorrect. The upshot is that, once the dimensional structure of a set of items is verified, sum scores often have a solid psychometric basis and therefore are frequently quite adequate for psychological research.},

The five factors provide a particularly compelling model for interpreting the Axis II personality disorders as maladaptive variants of normal personality traits. However, we also discuss methodological and conceptual limitations of this application. There has been little research on the relationship of Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness to Axis I mental disorders, but considerable attention has been given to Neuroticism and Extraversion. We focus in particular on the difficulty in distinguishing between the various ways in which personality can relate to depression, either as a predisposition to, a complication of, a pathoplastic effect upon, or a spectrum variant of the mental disorder. We conclude with recommendations for future research.},

The author of the test provides results from confirmatory factor analyses in the technical manual supporting the five‐factor structure of the instrument. Other authors have examined this factor structure through EFA using the standardization sample, and have not found evidence of a five‐factor model. The purpose of the current study was to examine the internal construct validity of the SB5 using an independent sample of high‐functioning students. Participants included 201 high‐functioning, third‐grade students ranging in age from 8 years, 4 months to 10 years, 11 months. Five models of the SB5 were analyzed using Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS). Our findings indicated that a hierarchical, four‐factor, post‐hoc model provided the best fit to the data. Generally, implications for school psychologists include a better understanding of the factor structure of the SB5, especially as it relates to high‐achieving children.

  abstract = {The Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology is a quantitative diagnostic system that is gaining traction as a framework for studying the correlates of mental-health problems. However, it remains unknown how best to operationalize hierarchically related psychopathology dimensions during criterion validity tests. In a series of simulations, we evaluated the performance of latent-variable (i.e., structural equation modeling [SEM]) and factor-score representations of hierarchical psychopathology constructs in criterion validity analyses. In models based on continuously distributed psychopathology indicators (e.g., symptom composites), SEM and factor-score methods both tended to yield unbiased estimates of criterion validity coefficients. In contrast, for models based on dichotomous indicators (e.g., categorical diagnoses), SEM led to more accurate estimates than factor scores in most cases. We offer recommendations for psychopathology researchers based on these results and provide an R function ( https://osf.io/u3j5d/ ) that investigators can use to apply the approaches studied here in real-world data sets.},

  abstract = {This study explores the neurocognitive predictors of response to intervention with GraphoGame Rime (GG Rime), an adaptive software game designed to aid the learning of English phonics. A cohort of 398 children (aged 6–7 years) who had participated in a recent randomised controlled trial (RCT) of GG Rime in the United Kingdom were studied. Half were randomly assigned to play GG Rime and the other half were assigned to Business As Usual (BAU). A series of pretests were given prior to the intervention to all participants, designed to measure phonological awareness skills, executive function (EF) skills and the ability to synchronise finger tapping to a rhythmic beat. Rhythmic synchronisation has been linked to reading readiness and early reading attainment, and is related to phonological awareness. Individual differences prior to the intervention in all three types of measure were significantly associated with progression through the game. Gender was also important for progression through the game, with boys progressing significantly further than girls. Vocabulary was not a predictor of progression through the game. Playing time, rhythmic synchronisation, phonological skills and EF skills did not differ by gender. Once playing time and non-verbal cognitive ability were controlled, phonological awareness, EF, rhythmic synchronisation and gender all remained significant predictors of progression through the game. In further analyses comparing these predictors, their interactions and controlling for the autoregressor of prior responsiveness to phonics instruction, phoneme awareness and EF skills were the strongest unique predictors. Analyses with the whole cohort (analysing BAU and GG children independently) showed that all neurocognitive measures contributed to progress in reading and spelling over the school year. We conclude that individual differences in phonological skills and EF skills predict which children will benefit most from computer assisted reading interventions like GG Rime. Further, boys respond better to this computerised intervention than girls. Accordingly, to be maximally beneficial to poor readers, the supplementary use of GG Rime in addition to ongoing classroom literacy instruction could be especially targeted to boys, but should be accompanied by a focus on developing both oral phonological awareness and EF skills.}

Prior to the intervention, 54 children were administered the BBCS‐R and were divided into three groups, two of which received basic concept instruction. Once the intervention was completed, the children were reassessed with the BBCS‐R. Posttest scores were calculated for each BBCS‐R subtest and the Total Test and School Readiness Composites after controlling for the pretest scores. A MANOVA and sequential ANOVAs were conducted and proved a significantly higher performance of the two intervention groups compared to the control group. Effect sizes for five of the six BBCS‐R subtests were classified as large, with the sixth (Time/Sequence) classified as medium. Discriminant function coefficients found that the Texture/Material subtest contributed the most to the detection of differences between the groups. However, no significant difference between the two intervention groups was found. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Psychol Schs 41: 301–311, 2004.},

The given relationships were weighted by sample sizes. The dataset included 1038 independent samples (N~=~299,155) from 72 countries. The results generally supported the FE with the IQ gain of 0.22 points per year, but the magnitudes of the IQ gains depended on types of countries and age groups. Stronger FEs were evident in middle-income countries and younger generations. A multicausal explanatory framework should be utilized to explain the underlying mechanism of the secular IQ gains across factors.},

It suggests a more practical reconceptualization of CHC theory and functional nomenclature to describe CHC latent cognitive factors. The nomenclature associated with CHC theory has become more complex as scholars have elaborated upon the theory, introducing their additions and revisions to the taxonomy. In the late 1990s, Kevin McGrew negotiated the merger of Carroll's three-stratum theory with Cattell and Horn's fluid-crystallized model theory; he was thus instrumental in the ascendancy of the consolidated CHC model in the field of cognitive assessment. Philip Vernon's model was an important reconciliation of Charles Spearman's two-factor model and L. L. Thurstone's primary abilities. For any revision or refinement of the model to be considered valid, it too must be subjected to rigorous research, with each suggested addition, subtraction, or substitution carefully weighed and considered.}

This study extended Keith’s (1999) examination of bias across racial/ethnic groups for general and specific cognitive abilities predicting reading achievement. It employed a higher-order model of cognitive abilities based on Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) theory and a three-factor reading achievement model adapted from Niileksela et al. (2016). Using samples of 9- to 13-year-old Black, Hispanic, and White children from the WJ IV norming sample, models representing CHC cognitive abilities and reading demonstrated invariance across groups. Despite the fact that the models where CHC broad abilities predicted reading achievement were a poor fit, results indicated similar predictive relations for Black children as for other racial/ethnic groups. The CHC cognitive models employed are not acceptable to predict reading for Black children—and all children—within this age range.},

The goal of the current investigation was to increase the understanding of the relationship between metacognition and executive functions by assessing the relationships between metacognitive monitoring accuracy and the three component executive functions (updating, inhibition, and shifting) among college students. Metacognitive monitoring accuracy was measured using a knowledge monitoring accuracy (KMA) test. The three components of executive functions, updating, inhibition, and shifting were measured, respectively, using the ABCD updating task, the Stroop color–word interference test, and the letter–number task. The Tower of Hanoi task was used to measure the complex executive functions (inhibition and updating). Correlation and regression analyses were performed to examine the relationships. The results indicate that updating is the only component executive function that significantly correlated with metacognitive monitoring, suggesting that metacognition—specifically, metacognitive monitoring—is associated with at least one component of executive functioning.},

First, analysis of covariance was applied to the combination of four representative samples of individuals who were administered the following pairs of Wechsler batteries in counterbalanced order: Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence—Revised (WPPSI-R) and WPPSI-III ( N = 174), Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children — Third Edition (WISC-III) and WISC-IV ( N = 239), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale—Revised (WAIS-R) and WAIS-III ( N = 191), and WAIS-III and WAIS-IV ( N = 240). Second, equal percentile equating was applied to each of the samples independently. Although the two methods produced different patterns of results, both methods showed some evidence of variation in the magnitude of the Flynn effect across ability levels. These results call into question the practice of adjusting IQs based on an average expected Flynn effect in routine clinical evaluations.},

  abstract = {Large amounts of missing data could distort item parameter estimation and lead to biased ability estimates in educational assessments. Therefore, missing responses should be handled properly before estimating any parameters. In this study, two Monte Carlo simulation studies were conducted to compare the performance of four methods in handling missing data when estimating ability parameters. The methods were full-information maximum likelihood (FIML), zero replacement, and multiple imputation with chain equations utilizing classification and regression trees (MICE-CART) and random forest imputation (MICE-RFI). For the two imputation methods, missing responses were considered as a valid response category to enhance the accuracy of imputations. Bias, root mean square error, and the correlation between true ability parameters and estimated ability parameters were used to evaluate the accuracy of ability estimates for each method. Results indicated that FIML outperformed the other methods under most conditions. Zero replacement yielded accurate ability estimates when missing proportions were very high. The performances of MICE-CART and MICE-RFI were quite similar but these two methods appeared to be affected differently by the missing data mechanism. As the number of items increased and missing proportions decreased, all the methods performed better. In addition, the information on missing data could improve the performance of MICE-RFI and MICE-CART when the data set is sparse and the missing data mechanism is missing at random.},

However, causality remains unclear.                                         Methods               We extracted genetic instruments from large genome-wide association studies summary data and employed an inverse-variance weighted (IVW) approach within a random-effects model as the primary method of Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to estimate the overall effect of various physical activity statuses on intelligence. To assess IVW stability and MR sensitivity, we also utilized supplementary methods including weighted median, MR-Egger, and MR-PRESSO. Furthermore, multivariable MR analysis was conducted to examine the independent effects of each physical activity trait on intelligence.                                         Results               The MR primary results indicated that LST was negatively associated with intelligence (β = -0.133, 95\%CI: -0.177 to -0.090, p = 1.34×10–9), while SBW (β = 0.261, 95\% CI: 0.059 to 0.463, p = 0.011) may have a positive effect on intelligence; however, MVPA and SC did not show significant effects on intelligence. Inverse causality analyses demonstrated intelligence significantly influenced all physical activity states.                                         Conclusions               Our study highlights a bidirectional causal relationship between physical activity states and intelligence.},

  abstract = {Grandiose narcissism is considered a multidimensional personality trait that consists of two facets: narcissistic admiration and rivalry. Admiration is associated with a self-enhancement and a self-promotion tendency, while narcissistic rivalry reflects a self-defensive tendency aimed to protect the threatened ego and manifests in the devaluation of others. Prior research has shown that admiration correlates positively with intelligence overestimation. However, little research has examined how grandiose narcissism is associated with the evaluation of other people's intelligence, nor the conditions in which intelligence assessment responses may be moderated. Consequently, we created two experimental situations where participants (N~=~328) recalled an autobiographical memory: (1) where they felt rejected; and (2) where they felt accepted. Based on their memory of the event, they then evaluated the person's intelligence, as well as other attributes (from communal and agentic domains). Generally, people in the rejected condition evaluated others as having lower communal attributes (e.g., empathy) and lower intelligence (but not other agentic attributes), in comparison to the acceptance condition. Additionally, whereas admiration was associated positively with self-assessed intelligence, rivalry correlated negatively with the evaluation of others' intelligence across both conditions (i.e., acceptance/rejection). Thus, those with high rivalry appear to consistently hold negative views about others.},

  abstract = {Educators are increasingly implementing holistic approaches into the foreign language classroom, with one popular method being mindfulness. Mindfulness has been associated with better grades and well-being in higher education. However, no study has yet explored the language-specific relationship between mindfulness and second language acquisition (SLA). This study investigated the relationship between the mindfulness level of 269 Japanese undergraduates and their ability to learn new L3 words in German. The study further examined the extent to which different domains of mindfulness were related to the ability to learn new vocabulary, as well as the relationship between mindfulness and the different vocabulary test parts (receptive, productive, grammatical gender). Correlation and multiple regression analyses revealed that higher mindfulness was associated with better vocabulary retention. In particular, the mindfulness dimension “Acting with Awareness” was key for all connections. Notably, the L1 and L3 parts showed a different relationship with different mindfulness dimensions: “Non-judging” was crucial for the productive part and “Observing” was decisive for the receptive part. These findings indicate that mindfulness not only improves general academic performance, but also has a direct relationship with SLA. Finally, this suggests that mindfulness training for students may be a novel approach to facilitate vocabulary learning.},

  abstract = {School grades are still used by universities and employers for selection purposes. Thus, identifying determinants of school grades is important. Broadly, two predictor categories can be differentiated from an individual difference perspective: cognitive abilities and personality traits. Over time, evidence accumulated supporting the notion of the g-factor as the best single predictor of school grades. Specific abilities were shown to add little incremental validity. The current paper aims at reviving research on which cognitive abilities predict performance. Based on ideas of criterion contamination and deficiency as well as Spearman’s ability differentiation hypothesis, two mechanisms are suggested which both would lead to curvilinear relations between specific abilities and grades. While the data set provided for this special issue does not allow testing these mechanisms directly, we tested the idea of curvilinear relations. In particular, polynomial regressions were used. Machine learning was applied to identify the best fitting models in each of the subjects math, German, and English. In particular, we fitted polynomial models with varying degrees and evaluated their accuracy with a leave-one-out validation approach. The results show that tests of specific abilities slightly outperform the g-factor when curvilinearity is assumed. Possible theoretical explanations are discussed.},

  abstract = {This short article provides a legal analysis of the Hale et al. white paper on specific learning disabilities identification. The white paper presents a purported consensus of experts that an approach combining response to intervention with severe discrepancy is consistent with the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The analysis examines the white paper position in relation to the IDEA legislation, regulations, and agency policy interpretations. The conclusions are that this position is legally flawed in terms of its reliance on the “pattern of strengths and weaknesses” provision, its failure to consider state special education laws, and its overemphasis on the processing component. As a result, the position is justifiable only as advocating revisions, rather than in finding support, in the law.},

  abstract = {Background. Skill learning (e.g., reading, spelling and maths) has been predominantly treated separately in the neuropsychological literature. However, skills (as well as their corresponding deficits), tend to partially overlap. We recently proposed a multi-level model of learning skills (based on the distinction among competence, performance, and acquisition) as a framework to provide a unitary account of these learning skills. In the present study, we examined the performance of an unselected group of third- to fifth-grade children on standard reading, spelling, and maths tasks, and tested the relationships among these skills with a network analysis, i.e., a method particularly suited to analysing relations among different domains. Methods. We administered a battery of reading, spelling, and maths tests to 185 third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade children (103 M, 82 F). Results. The network analysis indicated that the different measures of the same ability (i.e., reading, spelling, and maths) formed separate clusters, in keeping with the idea that they are based on different competences. However, these clusters were also related to each other, so that three nodes were more central in connecting them. In keeping with the multi-level model of learning skills, two of these tests (arithmetic facts subtest and spelling words with ambiguous transcription) relied heavily on the ability to recall specific instances, a factor hypothesised to underlie the co-variation among learning skills. Conclusions. The network analysis indicated both elements of association and of partial independence among learning skills. Interestingly, the study was based on standard clinical instruments, indicating that the multi-level model of learning skills might provide a framework for the clinical analysis of these learning skills.},

To use a package, you must first install it on your machine. You only need to install it once.\n\n## Install tidyverse \n\nSome packages are designed to work with several other packages as a system. The [tidyverse package](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a \"meta-package\" that installs and loads a coherent set of packages designed to help you import, manipulate, visualize, and interpret data. If you do not have a recent version of tidyverse already installed, you can install it with this code:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Install easystats\n\nThe [easystats](https://easystats.github.io/easystats/) package is another \"meta-package\" that installs a set of packages designed to work together to make data analysis easier.\n\n\nIf you do not have a recent version of easystats already installed, you can install it with this code:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"easystats\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Load packages\n\nA package that is installed on your machine has additional functions that you can use. Each session, you can \"load\" a package with the `library` function:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse) # Loads primary packages for data wrangling and plotting\nlibrary(easystats) # Loads packages that make extracting data from model fit objects easier\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Import data\n\n:::{.column-margin}\nIf I use only one data set in an analysis, I call it `d`. If I need multiple data sets, I use a `d_` prefix to differentiate them. For example, if I have separate data sets for juniors and seniors, I might call them, `d_juniors` and `d_seniors`, respectively. This kind of consistency seems like extra work, but it pays off in making it easy for *future-you* to read and understand your own code.\n:::\n\nYou can import the `height.csv` data set directly from my github repository for this course. There is no need to save the data anywhere. \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nd <- read_csv(\"https://github.com/wjschne/EDUC5325/raw/master/height.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\nThis code reaches across the web to the file in quotes, \"reads\" it into our session, and holds the data in a new variable we called `d`. Every time we need the data, we will get it from the `d` variable.\n\nThe `head` function, by default, displays the first 6 rows of a `data.frame` (a collection of variables in which all columns have the same number of rows) or `tibble` (a `data.frame` with various enhancements for printing and data creation).\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(d)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n<div class=\"kable-table\">\n\n| idnum| avgphgt| income| calcium| age|gender | weight| height|  smoke15|\n|-----:|-------:|------:|-------:|---:|:------|------:|------:|--------:|\n|     1|    67.5|  36000|    1000|  22|male   |    203|     66| 4.352451|\n|     2|    70.0|  45000|     800|  23|male   |    174|     71| 1.755834|\n|     3|    72.5|  32000|     750|  19|male   |    223|     74| 0.000000|\n|     4|    66.5|  55000|     600|  18|male   |    175|     69| 3.054213|\n|     5|    65.0|  56000|     450|  21|male   |    144|     70| 0.000000|\n|     6|    72.0| 100000|    1200|  34|male   |    219|     74| 0.000000|\n\n</div>\n:::\n:::\n\n*Dataset variables*\n\n- `idnum` An identifying variable for each student\n- `avgphgt` Average of parent height\n- `income` Parental income\n- `calcium` Calcium intake\n- `age` Student age\n- `gender` Student gender\n- `weight` Student weight (in pounds)\n- `height` Student height (in inches)\n- `smoke15` Number of cigarettes smoked per week\n\n\n# Make a plot\n\nLet's predict student height (`height`) from the average of their parents' height (`avgphgt`).\n\nUse the [`ggplot`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggplot.html) function from the [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package to make a scatterplot with points and a regression line in @fig-regressionplot.\n\n::: {.cell .preview-image}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(d, aes(avgphgt, height)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Regression line with its 95% confidence region](regression_files/figure-html/fig-regressionplot-1.png){#fig-regressionplot width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n@fig-annotated gives an annotated explanation of what the code does.\n\n![Annotated ggplot2 code](ggplotcode.svg){#fig-annotated}\n\nNote that this plot is not quite presentation worthy.

It will save whatever the last plot you created with [`ggplot`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggplot.html). It will guess the file format from the file extension. \n\nHere I save a .pdf file of the plot to the working directory:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggsave(\"my_plot.pdf\")\n```\n:::\n\nWhat is the working directory? Is the folder on your machine that R thinks it should look first if it needs to find files or save files. If you are ever curious about which directory is the working directory, you can see the current working directory with the `getwd` function:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngetwd()\n```\n:::\n\nIf you saved the plot above as `\"my_plot.pdf\"`, you will find the file in the working directory returned by `getwd`.\n\nIf you need to set the working working directly to something different from what it is, use the `setwd` function. In the `Session` menu in RStudio, you can also set the working directory with a point-an-click dialog box.\n\n\n## Vector-based images\n\nThe .pdf format gives the best image quality but can only be viewed in a .pdf reader. The .svg format is almost as good and can be incorporated into webpages and Office documents. One downside of their near-perfect image quality is that .pdf and .svg image file sizes can become quite large. \n\n## Raster images\n\nThe .png format gives good image quality and renders small file sizes. I prefer using the `ragg::agg_png` device to render a .png because it allows me to use any system font with no extra fuss. \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggsave(\"my_plot.png\", device = ragg::agg_png)\n```\n:::\n\nThe primary use of the .gif format is to create animated plots. Otherwise stick with .png.\n\nAlthough the .jpg format is good for photos, it is terrible for plots---it often renders text and sharp corners with pixelated smudges. \n\n# Creating the regression model\n\nTo run regression models, use the [`lm`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/lm) function. The `lm` stands for \"linear model.\" The general pattern is `lm(Y~X, data = d)`, which means \"`Y` is predicted by `X`, using the data set `d`.\"\n\nHere we predict height from Average of Parent Height (`avgphgt`):\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nm1 <- lm(height~avgphgt, data = d)\n```\n:::\n\nNotice that we did not get any results. Instead, we created the model fit object `m1`, which contains information about the model. There are a variety of functions we can use to extract information from `m1`.\n\n# Checking assumptions\n\nRegression assumes that the observations should independent, and the residuals should be normal and homoscedastic. The [performance package](https://easystats.github.io/performance/index.html) has a great function for checking model assumptions: [`check_model`](https://easystats.github.io/performance/reference/check_model.html)\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncheck_model(m1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Regression diagnostic plots](regression_files/figure-html/fig-checkmodel-1.png){#fig-checkmodel width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\nIn @fig-checkmodel we see that none of the assumptions have been severely violated. Normally, we would stop here. If needed, we can look at each plot one at a time.\n\n## Posterier Predictions\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndiagnostic_plots <- plot(check_model(m1, panel = FALSE))\ndiagnostic_plots[[1]]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Posterior Predictive Check](regression_files/figure-html/fig-posterior-1.png){#fig-posterior width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\nThe @fig-posterior generates several sets of random \"simulated\" data based on the model and plots the distributions as the thin blue lines. Each simulated data set is of the same size as the original data. The thicker green line is based on the observed data. If the blue lines have roughly the same shape as the green line, then the model is likely of the right form. \n\nThe green line is not that far off from the blue lines, but the green line appears to have 2 peaks, and most of the blue lines have one peak. Because we know that males and females have different mean heights, there is a good chance that we need to model their heights separately. We will do so later in the tutorial.\n\nThe [tutorial for the `check_model` function](https://easystats.github.io/performance/articles/check_model.html) gives an example of a posterior prediction check that signals that something is awry.\n\n## Linearity Assumption\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndiagnostic_plots[[2]]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Linearity assumption](regression_files/figure-html/fig-linearity-1.png){#fig-linearity width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\nIn @fig-linearity, we see that the fitted values (i.e., $\\hat{Y}$ or predicted values) plotted against the residuals is roughly flat and horizontal. If the green line were clearly not flat, we would consider non-linear models.\n\n## Homogeneity of Variance Assumption\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndiagnostic_plots[[3]]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Homogeneity of variance assumption](regression_files/figure-html/fig-homogeneity-1.png){#fig-homogeneity width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n@fig-homogeneity is similar to @fig-linearity except that the fitted values are  standardized (i.e., converted to z-scores) and then square root of their absolute values are plotted on the *Y*-axis. The homogeneity of variance assumption requires that variability of the residuals should be roughly the same across the entire distribution of fitted values. Thus, the line in @fig-homogeneity should be roughly flat and horizontal, which it is. Indeed, we can draw a horizontal line entirely within the gray confidence region around the green line.\n\n## Influential Observations and Outlier Detection\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndiagnostic_plots[[4]]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Influential observations](regression_files/figure-html/fig-influential-1.png){#fig-influential width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\nSometimes a single outlier can radically alter a regression model. The plot in @fig-influential shows how influential each point is in creating the regression model. If any point is outside the green dotted lines, we might worry that the point has had undue influence on the model.\n\nMany additional outlier detection methods are available via the `check_outliers` function:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncheck_outliers(m1, method = \"all\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nOK: No outliers detected.\n- Based on the following methods and thresholds: zscore_robust (3.291), iqr (2), ci (1), cook (0.706), mahalanobis (13.816), mahalanobis_robust (13.816), mcd (13.816), ics (0.001), optics (4), lof (0.001).\n- For variable: (Whole model)\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Normality Assumption\n\nThe normality assumption does not require that all variables be normal. It requires that the prediction residuals be approximately normal. \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndiagnostic_plots[[5]]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Normality assumption](regression_files/figure-html/fig-normality-1.png){#fig-normality width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf the residuals were perfectly normal, the blue dots would fall exactly on the green line in @fig-normality. The blue dots are not that far from the green line. Because ordinary least squares is robust to minor violations of the normality assumption, nothing in @fig-normality should make us worry about needing to model the data with some other kind of residuals.\n\n\nIf we suspect that the residuals are generated from a different distribution, the `check_distribution` function will estimate the probability that the residuals (and response/outcome variable) come from 12 major distribution families:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncheck_distribution(m1) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n<div class=\"kable-table\">\n\n|Distribution               | p_Residuals| p_Response|\n|:--------------------------|-----------:|----------:|\n|bernoulli                  |     0.00000|    0.00000|\n|beta                       |     0.03125|    0.00000|\n|beta-binomial              |     0.00000|    0.40625|\n|binomial                   |     0.00000|    0.40625|\n|cauchy                     |     0.09375|    0.03125|\n|chi                        |     0.03125|    0.03125|\n|exponential                |     0.00000|    0.00000|\n|F                          |     0.00000|    0.00000|\n|gamma                      |     0.00000|    0.00000|\n|half-cauchy                |     0.00000|    0.00000|\n|inverse-gamma              |     0.00000|    0.00000|\n|lognormal                  |     0.00000|    0.00000|\n|neg. binomial (zero-infl.) |     0.00000|    0.03125|\n|negative binomial          |     0.06250|    0.00000|\n|normal                     |     0.59375|    0.03125|\n|pareto                     |     0.03125|    0.00000|\n|poisson                    |     0.00000|    0.00000|\n|poisson (zero-infl.)       |     0.00000|    0.03125|\n|tweedie                    |     0.15625|    0.00000|\n|uniform                    |     0.00000|    0.00000|\n|weibull                    |     0.00000|    0.03125|\n\n</div>\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(check_distribution(m1))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](regression_files/figure-html/m1checkdistribution-1.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\nHere we see that of the 12 major distribution families tested, the residuals are more likely normal than any of the others. After we control for gender, this probability will increase. If the results had strongly suggested the residuals were generated from one of the other distributions, we might consider switching from a linear model to a [generalized linear model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model).\n\n\n\n\n\n# Summarising results\n\nBase R gives you most of what you would want to know about the regression results with the `summary` function:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(m1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = height ~ avgphgt, data = d)\n\nResiduals:\n   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n-5.241 -1.649 -0.539  1.224  6.163 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

It makes it easy for other scholars to see exactly where each number came from. Hard-coded results are harder to trust.\n\nRegression errors are the vertical distances of the outcome variable and regression line. That is, errors are the difference between the outcome and the predicted outcome: \n\n$$\ne=Y-\\hat{Y}\n$$\n\n### Standard Error of the Estimate (*&sigma;~e~*)\n\nThe *standard error of the estimate* (i.e., Sigma in the `performance` output table) is the standard deviation of the regression errors $\\sigma_{e}$. It represents the typical size of the prediction error. That is, when we make a prediction, how far off is that prediction likely to be? \n\nThe standard error of the estimate can be extracted from a regression fit object with the `sigma` function:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsigma(m1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2.68\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nAlternately, it can be extracted from the `performance` function's output:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nperformance(m1)$Sigma\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2.681034\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Coefficient-level statistics\n\nThe regression coefficients---the intercept (*b*~0~) and the slope (*b*~1~)---have a number of statistics associated with them, which we will discuss later in the course.\n\nIf you just wanted the intercept and the slope coefficients, use the `coef` function:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncoef(m1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n(Intercept)     avgphgt \n     -12.88        1.19 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nThus, the intercept is -12.88 and the slope is 1.19.\n\nTo get the model parameters (intercept and slope coefficients) along with their standard errors, confidence intervals, *t* statistics, and *p*-values:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nparameters(m1) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n<div class=\"kable-table\">\n\n|Parameter   | Coefficient|    SE|   CI|  CI_low| CI_high|     t| df_error|     p|\n|:-----------|-----------:|-----:|----:|-------:|-------:|-----:|--------:|-----:|\n|(Intercept) |      -12.88| 9.779| 0.95| -32.675|    6.92| -1.32|       38| 0.196|\n|avgphgt     |        1.19| 0.145| 0.95|   0.899|    1.49|  8.23|       38| 0.000|\n\n</div>\n:::\n:::\n\nStandardized parameters are the regression coefficients if all variables in the analysis were standardized (i.e., convernted to *z*-scores).

We would predict that males are, on average, taller than females. \n\nBy default, the first category in a factor or character (text) variable is the \"reference level\" that all other categories are compared to. In R, a factor can list categories in any order. In character variables, the categories are listed in alphabetical order. The `gender` variable consists of text, so the `lm` function puts the \"female\" category first and the \"male\" category second. Thus, the regression coefficient for `gender` will refer to how much \"Males\" differ from \"Females,\" on average. If want to do it the other way around, you can reverse the order of the levels and labels in the `factor` function. See also the [`fct_rev`](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/fct_rev.html) or [`fct_relevel`](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/fct_relevel.html) function for other ways to do this.\n\n\nWe run the regression model with 2 predictors like so:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nm2 <- lm(height ~ avgphgt + gender, data = d)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Checking assumptions\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncheck_model(m2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Assumption check for model 2](regression_files/figure-html/fig-checkmodelm2-1.png){#fig-checkmodelm2 width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\nThe diagnostic plots in @fig-checkmodelm2 looks good. It has one additional plot checking the collinearity of the predictors. If any predictor is strongly predictable from the other predictors, it is difficult for ordinary least squares regression to locate the regression coefficients with precision. Why? Because the regression coefficients represent the independent effect of each variable controlling for all the other variables. If a predictor has little variability left after controlling for the other variables, estimating its independent effect is difficult, which is manifest in \"inflated\" standardized errors around the coefficient. The VIF (variance inflation factor) statistic estimates how much the standard errors are made large due to collinearity. If the VIF is larger than 10 or so, it is likely that the estimate of the coefficient is not precise.\n\n## Summarizing results\n\nTo summarize the results, use the `summary` function:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(m2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = height ~ avgphgt + gender, data = d)\n\nResiduals:\n   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n-3.826 -1.094 -0.347  1.656  4.503 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

When the red dot has an extreme value of *x*, it can easily alter where the regression line will be, depending on the value of *y*. That is, extreme values of *x* have *leverage*. When the red dot has a value of *x* in the middle, the value of *y* will have little effect on the location of the regression line. Thus, values of *x* near the mean have little leverage. When there are multiple predictors, the hat values help spot cases with leverage even though a visualization is not always possible.\n\n![Animation showing preditor values with high and low leverage](leverage.gif){#fig-leverage}\n\n\n# All the code in one place:\n\nThe preceding analyses might seem like a lot, but it is not really so much when you see it all in just a few lines of code.

A set of 38 inmates participated in a study that tested the Transfer of Learning Hypothesis. Some people believe that studying Latin is particularly beneficial for progress in other academic disciplines. Each inmate was given a reading test and a math test before the study began. Some inmates were randomly assigned to participate in a 48-week Latin course. The control group studied the lives of famous athletes for the same time period. Each inmate took the reading and math test again to see if studying Latin improved their academic skills. Personal information was also collected about each inmate including their annual income before going to prison, whether or not the inmate had a documented learning disorder, and whether or not the inmate had been convicted of a violent offense. Here are the variable names:\n\n* `read_1` = Reading before study\n* `read_2` = Reading after study\n* `math_1` = Math before study\n* `math_2` = Math after study\n* `latin` = 1 (Studied Latin), 0 (Studied sports history)\n* `violent` = 1 (convicted of a violent offense), 0 (convicted of a non-violent offense)\n* `learning` = 1 (Learning disabled), 0 (Not learning disabled)\n* `income` = Annual income before incarceration\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nd_learn <- read_csv(\"https://github.com/wjschne/EDUC5529/raw/master/transfer_of_learning.csv\") \n```\n:::\n\nAssume &alpha; = 0.05 for all hypothesis tests.\n\nCreate a regression model in which you predict reading at time 2 (`read_2`) using reading at time 1 (`read_1`).
